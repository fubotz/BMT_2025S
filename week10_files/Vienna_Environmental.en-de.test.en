The basic principles of Viennese waste management are waste prevention, waste separation and waste utilisation 
Waste Balance 
In addition to the Federal Waste Management Act, waste management in Vienna is regulated by the Viennese Waste Management Act (Wiener AWG). 
There are two municipal departments responsible for waste management in Vienna, namely the Municipal Department for Waste Management, Street Cleaning and Vehicle Fleet (MA 48), and the Municipal Department for Environmental Protection (MA 22). 
While MA 48 is responsible for the communal collection and treatment of waste from private households and companies, MA 22 has the task of monitoring the implementation of waste regulations. 
At a strategic level, they work together on the realisation of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) for the Viennese Waste Management Plan, for example, or on the initiation of waste prevention projects. 
The basic principles of Viennese waste management are waste prevention, waste separation and waste utilisation. 
Efforts to fulfil these principles mean that waste management is subject to constant optimisation measures and new challenges. 
A study and an analysis, the latter carried out in 2003/2004, led to recognition of the problem of food and food packaging in residual waste and this was reacted to accordingly. 
A very successful poster campaign was implemented with the “Müllmonster”, or rubbish monster, (whose motto roughly translated as “I’m big enough already”) throughout the Vienna area, and there was a corresponding prioritisation of waste prevention projects. 
In spite of the great efforts in waste prevention, MA 48 still collects more than one million tonnes of waste every year. 
It is necessary to separate this waste as much as possible to create the conditions for efficient material recycling. 
A sophisticated collection system ensures that waste separation and utilisation are not just mere buzzwords in Vienna. 
In 2004/2005, in order to optimise collection of separated waste and to facilitate the subsequent recycling process, plastic collection was altered to a targeted collection of recyclable plastic fractions (hollow containers) and the glass collection changed to soundabsorbing bottle banks which are lifted to be emptied. 
In compost management, the path that has been followed for many years, namely closed organic cycle management, is being continued consistently. 
Waste that cannot be prevented or utilised primarily ends up at one of the two waste incineration plants, or, after being treated, in the fluidised-bed incinerator IV. 
A rotary kiln is available in Vienna for incineration of hazardous waste, and the energy that arises from this incineration process is used to generate environmentally friendly district heating and also electricity in part. 
Quantity of Waste in 2005 In 2005, the quantity of waste collected by MA 48 totalled 1,018,207 tonnes. This shows a slight reduction in comparison with 2004 (1,026,431 tonnes). 
The decrease can be mainly attributed to the moderate use of loose gravel (to grit the roads and pavements) in winter 2004/ 2005. 
If the total waste amount is divided evenly between the population of Vienna, this would indicate an average waste production of 612 kilograms for each Viennese resident. 
More than half of the total waste produced in 2005 was utilised to generate heat and around 36 per cent was recycled. 
Waste Collection 
MA 48 is responsible for waste collection in Vienna. 
A sophisticated collection system ensures that Vienna stays clean. 
It comprises a container system for residual waste collection and a system for scrap material collection (including biogenic waste) made up of 2,500 collecting points, 50 hazardous waste collection points and 19 rubbish dumps. 
Every day, some 100,000 containers are emptied by 261 waste collection trucks. 
All new trucks that are heavier than 3.5 tonnes are already equipped with EURO-IV engines and have a PM-cat filter system with an upstream oxidation catalytic converter, which complies with and exceeds the legally required limits that come into force in October 2006.This technology is a great step towards a reduction in particulate matter! 
Residual Waste Collection “Residual waste” stands for the mixture that cannot be gathered in the separated scrap material collection. 
It mainly comes from private households, but also from companies that dispose of commercial waste that is similar to domestic waste in the same containers as households. 
In Vienna, residual waste is collected directly from properties in some 206,000 containers and these containers are emptied up to six times a week as required. 
Incidentally, there is a research project at Spittelau waste incineration plant that is focused on the composition of Vienna’s residual waste and on how the concentrations of the examined elements in the residual waste change over time. 
Since 2000, the elementary composition and the substance flows of the most important elements in the residual waste burnt there have been determined. 
The “output” is also being examined, in other words the combustion products. 
The result: 
In the last five years, the cadmium and mercury concentrations in Vienna’s residual waste dropped by 30 per cent, while copper concentrations rose by about 45 per cent, lead by 30 per cent and aluminium by 16 per cent, whereby only the reduction of cadmium is significant. 
Separated Scrap Material Collection “Separated scrap material collection” is the collection of the scrap material paper, coloured glass, clear glass, metals (including beverage cans) and plastic hollow containers. 
The colour of each container’s lid indicates which scrap material should be disposed of in the container. 
In addition, the containers are marked with corresponding stickers for correct use. 
In the entire city area, around 185,000 containers are in place for the different scrap materials, including biogenic waste. 
The containers for waste paper are located either directly on properties (in the inner city) or on a nearby public waste container site (in green areas). 
Scrap metal (beverage cans, metal packaging material and small pieces of metal), waste glass and plastic bottles can now be discarded at over 2,500 collecting points. 
All scrap material can also be disposed of for free at the 19 rubbish dumps. 
The collected waste glass is supplied to the glass industry to be utilised and the metals are sold to metal melting companies. 
The paper industry makes new paper products from the waste paper. 
In autumn 2004, after successful pilot tests, reorganisation of the plastic collection and waste glass collection systems was initiated. 
• The goal of reorganising the plastic collection system was to improve the quality of the collected material. 
From September 2004 to April 2005 in Vienna, the accustomed mixed lightweight packaging collection was replaced by targeted collection of hollow containers such as plastic bottles. 
In Vienna, all other plastics that are not used for recycling are collected in the residual waste and are used as fuel because of their high calorific value. 
The plastic bottle containers were redesigned in an eye-catching manner with a closed lid with round necks to insert the bottles. 
These ensure that the correct waste ends up inside the containers to a large extent. 
Previously, up to 30 per cent incorrect waste was collected in these containers, which led to extensive work during the subsequent sorting process. 
The results show that there has been a significant reduction in wrongly discarded waste in the new containers and an increase in recyclable hollow containers. 
In the case of business enterprises, the old “yellow bin” system has been retained, because mainly large plastic films are collected here and there is much less wrongly discarded waste. 
The recyclable plastics are used by the plastic industry to make new products such as shampoo and detergent bottles, containers, buckets, bags and fleece fibres. 
• Due to noise pollution and an increase in collection efficiency, the extensive changeover to “lifted” bottle banks has been started in several Vienna districts (2, 20, 21 and 22). These new bottle banks are lifted up by a crane to be emptied, and thanks to their material properties they cause much less noise pollution when bottles are inserted. 
These new containers bring reductions of more than 10 decibels, which is equivalent to half of the previous noise levels. 
The closed container design also leads to a better quality of collected material. 
In 2006, this changeover is to be extended to include all of Vienna. 
Implementation of the Ordinance on Waste Prevention, Collection and Treatment of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE Ordinance) When the WEEE Ordinance came into force, it led to fundamental innovations in collection and utilisation of waste electrical and electronic equipment. 
A key factor is that citizens now have the opportunity to hand in all waste electrical equipment at the MA 48 collection points for free. 
This has led to a significant reduction in illegally discarded appliances. 
In 2004, MA 48 had to remove around 8,400 refrigeration appliances which had been discarded in public areas; in 2005 this number had dropped to just 5,800! 
MA 48 has concluded a contract with several manufacturers concerning the collection and processing of waste electrical appliances.The manufacturers have commissioned MA 48 to dispose of the waste electrical appliances received at the MA 48 collection points in an environmentally friendly manner. 
In this way, MA 48 will ensure proper collection and treatment of the waste electrical appliances in Vienna now and in the future. 
Biogenic Waste There is also a separate collection system for biogenic waste. 
The biowaste containers are in place extensively in the city’s green areas, and in the inner-city area citizens can deposit their garden and kitchen waste at collecting points. 
The biogenic waste is converted to high-quality compost that is primarily used in agriculture. 
Illegal Waste Disposal Illegal waste disposal poses a continual environmental problem. 
Monitoring plays an essential role here and is carried out by employees of MA 48 on public property and by employees of the specialist area “waste and resource management” of MA 22 on private property. 
In 2005, they were “deployed” a total of 140 times to help bring charges against perpetrators of illegal waste disposal, at freight train stations and old industrial sites for example. 
The mobile task force of the environmental protection department ensured the removal of 200 old vehicles, 500 cubic metres of bulky waste, 500 cubic metres of building waste and some 100 refrigeration appliances in 2005. 
Waste Treatment Plant The majority of the scrap material collected in Vienna or brought directly to the collecting points by business enterprises can be directly forwarded to companies for use without further processing or sorting steps. Materials that fall into this category are waste paper, waste glass, polystyrene, scrap tyres, treated wood and vehicle wrecks. 
In the waste treatment plant, the remaining scrap material is sorted into fractions in preparation for recycling, and is temporarily stored and marketed. 
A rail connection is available for the removal and handling of scrap material. 
Sorting and Processing Plants In addition to the plastics sorting plant, the waste processing site also houses a treatment and sorting plant for domestic and bulky waste, a central hazardous waste interim storage facility, a processing plant for combustion residues, a compost processing plant and an electronic/electrical scrap disassembly plant. 
Residual waste that due to the insufficient capacity of the two existing waste incineration plants cannot be thermally treated has been ptocessed in a sorting and treatment plant for domestic and bulky waste since 2001. 
With this plant, it is possible to separate the parts that are high in calorific value and the recyclable metals from the domestic waste. 
Successful “Waste Separation Point” Model for Construction Sites The two themes “Aesthetic Incorporation of Construction Sites into the Cityscape” and “Pre-sorting of Residual Building Materials on the Building Site” were implemented to reduce the environmental impact of overall waste logistics as part of the RUMBA EU project (see “Mobile in Vienna” chapter). 
This was achieved by setting up a waste separation point. 
This is an area on the construction site which is cordoned off and can only be accessed at certain times, and which contains waste collection containers for the construction waste that is normally produced during interior building work. 
At the waste separation point, this waste is taken over by trained personnel and sorted into individual types of waste. 
The specialists on the construction site are contractually obliged to dispose of their waste via the waste separation point. 
Once the construction is completed, the waste separation point operator gives all the residual building material verification documents to the building owner. This saves the building owner from having to collect them from the individual specialists. 
Within the framework of the RUMBA project, standardised specification texts were prepared for the invitation to tender for “Waste Separation Points” by Ökotechna together with the civil engineering task force from ÖkoKauf Wien (EcoBuy Vienna). They can be found at www. rumba-info.at. 
Thanks to these documents, it has been possible to implement the “Waste Separation Point” concept for several building projects already, most recently for the extension of the U2 metro line, where some 600 specialists were involved. 
Waste Disposal 
Waste that cannot be recycled is disposed of in two domestic waste incineration plants, the fluidised-bed incinerator IV and an incineration plant for hazardous waste. 
The special thing about these four incineration plants is that not only do they comply with the highest internationally recognised environmental standards, but that the energy created during the combustion process is used to generate environmentally friendly district heating and also electricity in part. 
Rautenweg Landfill Rautenweg landfill is the city of Vienna’s only mass-waste landfill. 
It has a landfill capacity of 13.7 million cubic metres as authorised according to water protection regulations and has been adapted to the technology specifications of the Landfill Ordinance. 
The landfill site is used mainly for residues from thermal waste treatment in the form of hardened, low-reaction ash/slag concrete. 
In order to protect the groundwater, the entire landfill is enclosed by two parallel sealing walls that reach down to the aquiclude layers (Vienna Chamber System). 
Since 1991, the city has used the landfill gas to generate electricity. 
In 2005, the plant converted around eight million cubic metres of gas into electrical energy and fed it into the network of the WIENER STADTWERKE.

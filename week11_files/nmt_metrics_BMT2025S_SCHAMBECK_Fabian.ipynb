It has been trained using direct assessments from WMT17 to WMT20, as well as direct assessments from the MLQE-PE corpus. Similar to other models, it generates scores ranging from 0 to 1. For those interested, we also offer larger versions of this model: Unbabel/wmt23-cometkiwi-da-xl with 3.5 billion parameters and Unbabel/wmt23-cometkiwi-da-xxl with 10.7 billion parameters.\n",

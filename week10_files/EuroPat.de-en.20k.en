One of the conical spiral discs is mounted at the outside of the brake bell 4, the other one at the bottom of the housing 6. 
Preparing a diphospholane L 
The design of the receptacle as a cup with a base can be seen in this regard. 
The process in accordance with claim 7, wherein the three-dimensional image is depicted in the form of at least one of a three-dimensional grid, and a three-dimensional waterfall diagram. 
According to another feature of the invention, the retaining ring is made as an O-ring. 
Alternatively, the valve unit 12 can be entirely or partially be made also of a different material, for example, metal. 
The preparation of isocyanates by phosgenation of the corresponding amines in a tubular reactor which has an elongated, jacketed guide tube centrally in the direction of the axis of rotation of the tubular reactor is described in EP-A 1 555 258. 
Their preparation is conventional, as mentioned, for example, in EP-A-0 384 609. 
For retaining conduit 14 in the opening 15, pipe lamella 16 are formed at the end of conduit 14, which, in the inserted state of the conduit 14, come to rest on opposite sides of the wall of pipe part 8 and firmly retain the conduit 14 in pipe part 8 and also seal it against the pipe part. 
The sanitary fitting according to this invention is characterized in that a flow stabilizer is provided on the water outlet side of the valve unit, i.e., in the outflow channel in the direction of flow in front of the gaskets and optionally also in the outlet channel. 
7 is a section through adjacent parts of membrane filter plates with an installed screwed joint before the application of pressure to the filter press 
In addition, this method produces large amounts of biological excess sludge. 
For a model, it is assumed that hydrophilic water-non-permeable cell membranes with pores suitable for material exchange are formed in a two-stage process. 
In addition, cresol and phenol sulfonic acid, organic substances, such as dextrin and/or thiourea and/or gelatine, are said to guarantee uniform coloring. 
The conveyed material reaches a dosing apparatus 4 which is arranged within a housing 5 and thus defines a weighing section of approx. 300° angle of rotation up to a delivery point 8 . 
Methanol is an especially advantageous alcohol because it is the simplest alcohol that is available. 
One advantageous embodiment of the disclosure provides that the first radial opening of the first and/or the second working connector is connected fluidic ally to in each case one axial face of the actuator. 
The household appliance according to claim 14, wherein: said external program selector is a rotary selector having a number of positions for selecting said programs; and 
Metal parts that are suitable for the treatment are metal parts the surface of which comes into contact with the polymer melt (“working surface”). 
This triggering unit is preferably integrated into the hardware-monitoring unit that belongs to the testing unit of the elevator apparatus. 
Furthermore the bulkhead has a very low heat capacity as compared to the container wall, so that the regenerating gas flowing between the walls 7 is minimally cooled. 
The closing element preferably consists at least in some area(s) or fully of a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) or a thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) with an elasticity modulus of approx. 2 MPa to approx. 10 MPa, in particular approx. 3 MPa or approx. 4 MPa. 
a polyisocyanate or a mixture of polyisocyanates, 
Such photomasks are needed for the exposure steps in semiconductor production.

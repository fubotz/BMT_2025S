This is also the reason why the expansion of district heating is an important measure in the Climate Protection Programme of the City of Vienna (KliP) and the Urban Air Initiative (ULI) which aims to reduce air pollutants, and in the Energy Efficiency Programme for the City of Vienna (SEP) which aims to increase energy efficiency. 
Fifteen generating plants currently feed hot water into the integrated district-heating network at 10 different locations. 
The waste heat from the domestic waste incinerators in Flötzersteig and Spittelau plus the Simmeringer Haide hazardous waste and sludge incineration plant is used as a base load all year round. 
The medium load is covered by CHP systems from the WIEN ENERGIE power stations in Donaustadt, Simmering and Leopoldau plus the two power plants in the OMV refinery in Schwechat. 
Peak boilers in the district heating works Arsenal, Kagran, Leopoldau, Spittelau and Inzersdorf (south) are started up only when these generating plants are no longer sufficient. 
At the end of the financial year 2004/2005, the installed capacity of all plants amounted to around 2,830 megawatts, which then generated 5,466 gigawatthours of district heat. 
Of this, 68.7 per cent came from CHP, 28.4 per cent from waste treatment plants and only 2.9 per cent from peak boilers. 
In the financial year 2004/2005, 5,872 apartments were retrofitted with district heating systems. 
This saves around 1,872 kilograms of CO2 emissions per apartment. 
When applied to the above-mentioned number of apartments, this results in a total annual saving of 10,992 tonnes of CO2. 
Improved Plant Efficiency An important focus of WIEN ENERGIE Fernwärme is ensuring and, if possible, improving efficiency in the plants and the district heating network, both now and in the future. 
A key foundation has already been laid for this in the selection of the new generating plants. 
Thus, from mid 2006 the heat from biomass combined heat and power plants will increase the share of renewable energy. 
The third waste incineration plant, which is set to start up in 2008, will ensure that all of Vienna’s municipal waste can be burned and used for district heat generation. 
The year 2008 should also see the renewal of Block 1/2 of the CHP power plant in Simmering, whereby the plant’s efficiency shall greatly increase and the district heating emissions shall fall further. 
The customer installations are another important element of district heating energy efficiency. 
The engineering department ensures that these installations are operated efficiently and carries out improvements if necessary. 
In the financial year 2004/2005, optimisations were carried out on a total of 71 customer installations, which led to a total reduction in capacity requirements of 11.4 megawatts. 
This lower capacity provides customers with a reduction in required energy, and also lowers the performance-related cost components of the district-heating invoice. 
In other words, the reduction of the connected load charge brings real cash savings. 
Europe’s Largest Denitrification Plant July 2004 saw the start of construction for Europe’s largest DeNOx plant (denitrification plant) for waste incinerators in the Simmeringer Haide plant. 
It is a joint plant for the existing incineration lines (fluidised-bed incinerators 1–3 and rotary kilns 1+2) at the Simmeringer Haide plant. 
After a construction period of roughly 10 months and a successfully completed performance test, the plant was taken over by WIEN ENERGIE Fernwärme in June 2005. 
Adding a denitrification plant to the existing flue gas cleaning stages ensures that the mandatory emission limits – from now on also the NOx limit of 100 milligrams per normal cubic metre valid from 28 December 2005 – are not only maintained, but also considerably improved on; a further important contribution to bettering the air quality in Vienna. 
In order to further raise the company’s awareness of the environment, safety and quality, to expand the standard of knowledge of the employees and to present and communicate the business activity in a transparent manner, WIEN ENERGIE Fernwärme decided to set up and maintain an integrated management system (environment, quality and safety) for the Simmeringer Haide plant with the assistance of the UTR Consulting Group. 
By participating in the certification systems EMAS II, ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and OHSAS 18001, WIEN ENERGIE Fernwärme has committed itself to carrying out continuous improvement measures in these areas that exceed the legal requirements. 
The certification was successfully completed on 20 January 2006. 
The Simmeringer Haide sludge and hazardous waste incineration plant is the first of its type in Europe to be awarded the integrated management system certificates and EMAS certification. 
WIEN ENERGIE Fernwärme Supplies District Cooling Air conditioning has been common in North America for several decades and has come to account for a considerable percentage of power consumption. 
Now cold generation for air conditioning is becoming ever more important in Europe. 
A study initiated by the EU Commission predicts that the number of room air conditioners in Europe will increase from 7.4 million in 1996 to 33 million in 2020. 
That is equivalent to an estimated 43.9 terawatt-hours. 
In comparison, the energy consumption of room air conditioners is currently 22.5 terawatt-hours in Europe. 
All studies indicate that Austria will be no exception in this development. 
Therefore, WIEN ENERGIE Fernwärme has opted to use district heating to generate cold via absorption cooling machines. 
Instead of electricity, waste heat from waste treatment is primarily used to generate cold, which enables savings in valuable primary energy. 
In the past financial year, a cooling supply contract was finalised by WIEN ENERGIE for the entire urban development project TownTown. 
The final decisive factor for a central cooling plant is the clearly higher efficiency and better environmental compatibility in comparison to 20 decentralised plants. 
The first “cold supply” is scheduled for 2006. 
WIEN ENERGIE Gasnetz Natural gas is the most environmentally friendly of all fossil fuels. 
Due to its high hydrogen content, natural gas combustion generates less carbon dioxide, which is responsible for the greenhouse effect. 
Emissions of unburnt elements such as soot can be avoided altogether. 
And among all fossil fuels, natural gas also has the lowest emissions of sulphur oxide and nitrogen oxides. 
Before being used as a primary energy source, natural gas does not first have to be laboriously converted or treated. 
Natural gas is also transported in an environmentally friendly manner which is almost invisible to the user. 
The devices that are continually developed by the gas appliance industry (keyword: calorific value combustion) offer customers efficient energy use coupled with environmental friendliness and minimum space requirements. 
The further development of gas combustion, burner components, and the like also contributes to a continual reduction in emissions. 
Reorganisation Measures Completed Due to the large number of possible applications on the room heating market, in process heat and also as fuel, increasing the natural gas percentage is an important point in the Vienna energy concept. 
The reorganisation measures begun in October 2002 in light of the market liberalisation have since been completed, so that WIEN ENERGIE Gasnetz can continue to carry out its activities as a modern, effective and efficiently running natural gas distribution network operator. 
For the quantity of conducted natural gas, the network balance of 2004/2005 shows a plus of around six per cent to 2.3 billion normal cubic metres. 
This increase is principally attributed to the increased use of energy in WIEN ENERGIE Wienstrom power stations. 
As in the past few years, it was possible to increase the number of natural gas heating systems – 9,500 new installations were connected to the natural gas network. 
The reduction of individual oven heating systems in favour of central heating not only contributes to an optimal use of natural gas but also to a further reduction in emissions. 
The rehabilitation of natural gas pipes was intensified on the basis of active environmental protection, noise reduction for residents and cost savings. 
Not only did this lead to minimisation of lorry traffic (transport of the excavation material and back-fill material), it also led to lower dust and noise pollution for the Viennese citizens due to less excavation work. 
In 2004/2005, 9.8 kilometres of natural gas pipelines were newly laid, 14.3 kilometres were replaced and 1,822.6 kilometres were examined by the gas detection service. 
WIEN ENERGIE Gasnetz operates a roughly 3,450 kilometre long pipeline network – using the highest of safety standards. 
Natural Gas Fleet Natural gas vehicles are the ideal combination of economic efficiency and environmental awareness. 
Nowadays they are well-engineered and available in series. 
Worldwide, over three million natural gas vehicles are already on the road. 
Compared with conventional vehicles, natural gas vehicles emit up to 95 per cent less nitrogen oxide, up to 25 per cent less CO2 and up to 80 per cent less particles. 
The EU has included natural gas in its objectives for vehicle power units. 
By 2020, natural gas should make up 10 per cent of fuel in the EU. 
WIEN ENERGIE Gasnetz currently operates 120 natural gas vehicles and this enables it to make savings of around €15,000 annually on fuel costs. 
By 2008, the vehicle fleet will comprise some 250 natural gas vehicles. 
By converting the entire fleet, the company expects to make annual cost savings of around €35,000 in comparison with conventional fuel. 
In order to facilitate fleet conversion for all the companies of the Wiener Stadtwerke Group (Vienna Public Enterprises) and in order to facilitate refuelling its own natural gas fleet, WIEN ENERGIE Gasnetz constructed its own company filling station at its Simmering office. This filling station opened in the spring of 2006. 
Alternative Combinations and Innovations In the future, conventional power suppliers will not be able to shut themselves off from regenerative energy supply possibilities. 
It is a case of not seeing the alternatives as competition, but rather as ecologically and economically sensible additions. 
WIEN ENERGIE Gasnetz recognised this fact early on and turned its attention to combination options of natural gas and alternative energy sources. 
A pilot project saw the installation of energy supply infrastructure for 220 new attic apartments at Hugo-Breitner-Hof in Vienna’s 14th district. 
In the spirit of active climate protection, the chosen energy sources were a combination of gas condensing boilers and a solar plant. 
The annual specific solar output is around 350 kilowatt-hours per square metre. 
The project illustrates not only that these types of combinations are suitable for environmentally friendly local heat use, but are also the first step towards achieving the goal of 300,000 square metres of installed collector area by 2010. 
The fuel cell project that was begun in April 2003 in co-operation with Vaillant was completed in May 2005.The insights gained from this project are now being incorporated into the further development of fuel cells, so as to push forward this future technology as regards system management and preparation for the market. 
WIEN ENERGIE ENERGIECOMFORT Environmental protection, conservation of resources and social responsibility are all values that the WIEN ENERGIE subsidiary ENERGIECOMFORT Energie- und Gebäudemanagement has been committed to since its formation in 1978. 
WIEN ENERGIE ENERGIECOMFORT plans, constructs, finances and operates all energy plants from the aspect of optimum performance and maximum cost savings for the customer – and all this is carried out with minimum impact on the environment. 
Around 25,000 megawatt-hours a year of the heat generated by WIEN ENERGIE ENERGIECOMFORT is based on the use of bioenergetic fuels. 
In February 2004, the geothermal plant TunnelThermie was put into operation in the sports secondary school Wien-Hadersdorf. 
The waste heat from the Lainzer Tunnel is used for the heating and hot water generation. 
By using geothermal energy, it was possible to save 29,000 cubic metres of natural gas. 
The annual CO2 emissions fell by approximately 30 tonnes. Further reductions were also achieved for NOx and CO. 
The project was conceived by WIEN ENERGIE ENERGIECOMFORT, the rail companies Eisenbahn-Hochleistungsstrecken AG and Schieneninfrastrukturfinanzierungsgesellschaft, and the city of Vienna and received an award of special recognition from the Energieprofi 2004 competition. 
In 2004, after a construction period of around just eight months, WIEN ENERGIE ENERGIECOMFORT started up a new 1.8 kilometre long bioheat network in Purkersdorf. 
Just under 460,000 litres of extra light fuel oil and 1,500 tonnes of CO2 could be saved in the biomass heating station’s first year in operation. 
In addition to the continual expansion of the existing WIEN ENERGIE ENERGIECOMFORT local-heating networks in Bad Aussee, Tannheim and Purkersdorf, the bioheat network in Kleinwalsertal is about to be implemented. 
The project comprises an installed capacity of 12 megawatts and a pipeline length of 16 kilometres. 
WIEN ENERGIE – Services Energy Consultation and Service Since 1985, WIEN ENERGIE has been offering its electricity, gas and district heating customers extensive energy advice and consultation. 
The WIEN ENERGIE Haus is the centre of these activities and very quickly established itself as a popular consultation, communication and competence centre for all energy issues. 
The guaranteed proximity to customer is seen not only through a number of customer service centres, the service phone number 0800 500 800 and the competent consultancy services available at the WIEN ENERGIE Haus, but also in a large number of services that help customers to achieve clarity and savings in their energy consumption. 
Examples of this are load management and power factor correction for electricity, hydraulic rehabilitation for district heating customers and online energy accounting. 
Manifold Energy Assistance Measures The city of Vienna’s energy assistance measures are based on the three pillars of energy avoidance, efficient energy use and energy generation that requires modest resources. 
For example, building a one-family or two-family house that fulfils certain thermotechnical criteria is supported with a one-time nonrepayable building cost grant. 
This grant, which is awarded in addition to the housing promotion assistance, amounts between €5,800 to €9,800 for low-energy houses, and €11,500 for passive houses. 
In 2005, around 110 low-energy houses and seven passive houses were promoted by the Municipal Department for Technical and Financial Assessment in Matters of Housing Construction and Promotion, Specialised Urban Renewal (MA 25). 
The Thewosan campaign for the thermal and energy-oriented rehabilitation of residential buildings has been in force since March 2000. 
The amount of the assistance is staggered. 
It increases the higher the energy saving or the better the thermal building quality after renovation. 
In 2005, 5,826 residential units were renovated with an effective area of 372,661 square metres, which led to energy savings of 23 gigawatthours. 
Since the launch of this promotion campaign, 51,772 residential units with a total effective area of almost 3.5 million square metres have been renovated, whereby around 462 gigawatt-hours of energy could be saved. 
In addition to the Thewosan programme, MA 25 has also been implementing energy-relevant measures in older residential buildings, for example heat insulation, installation of new windows, and energy-efficient heating and hot-water generation systems. 
In 2005, 2,211 residential units with an effective area of 257,325 square metres were renovated. 
The energy savings that this generated amount to some 20.68 gigawatt-hours a year. 
Since 1995, a total of 52,048 residential units with an effective area of approximately three million square metres have been renovated within the framework of this assistance programme, which has resulted in energy savings of around 233 gigawatt-hours. 
District Heating Makes Sense In connection with the measures to retrofit apartments with district heating systems, there are two assistance approaches available in Vienna via MA 50: 
• In 2005, 22 residential buildings were connected to district heating through the assistance programme of the Viennese Housing Promotion and Renovation Act (Wiener Wohnbauförderungs- und Wohnhaussanierungsgesetz [WWFSG]). 
The 1,170 apartments will now be gradually connected to the district-heating network. 
• With the help of the special promotion for district heating which was started in April 2003, a total of 57 buildings were connected to district heating in 2005, whereby at least 30 per cent of the apartments in these buildings were changed to district heating immediately. 
Thermal Solar Energy, Heat Pumps and Biomass The city of Vienna (MA 25) is supporting the installation of thermal solar plants to heat service water which may or may not be linked to the heating system with grants of up to 40 per cent of the eligible investment costs. 
In 2005, 153 applications for solar grants were processed with a collector area of over 2,000 square metres. 
This is a 10 per cent increase in comparison to 2004. 
In 2005, the sum allocated to solar assistance was fully expended for the first time. 
Around, €440,000 in assistance was paid out, which is an 89 per cent increase over 2003. 
An in-vestment volume of around €1.8 million was realised through solar promotion. 
A heat pump utilises the energy stored in the air, water and ground after solar irradiation by extracting energy from the environment. This energy is then used for heating or hot-water generation. 
The amount of assistance provided by MA 25 amounts to between €1,600 and €8,000 depending on the pump working type and utilisation. 
Overall in 2005, the number of assistance applications submitted for heat pumps rose to 82, which is a plus of 85 per cent in comparison with 2004. 
This is equivalent to an assistance volume of over €360,000. 
The promotion of biomass aims to increase the percentage of renewable energy sources in overall energy consumption. 
MA 50 covers part of the costs that arise in connection with the installation of biomass boiler systems and their maintenance. 
The grant amount for installation is between 33 per cent and 51 per cent, depending on the system’s emission performance, with an upper limit of €14,000. 
In 2005, 68 applications were filed for biomass assistance, which is twice as many as in 2004. 
The assistance amount that was paid out totalled over €200,000. 
Moreover, investments in electricity generation from renewable energy sources, including immaterial efforts such as basic concepts, studies and consultancy services, were also partially compensated. 
The extent of this funding amounted to up to 40 per cent of incurred costs. 
It has been possible to apply for assistance since the beginning of 2004 and 21 applications were submitted by the end of 2005, 17 of which concerned photovoltaic systems. 
There are currently 101 photovoltaic systems on the grid in Vienna. 
Their total capacity is 469 kilowatts, which is equal to an average capacity of 4.6 kilowatts. 
They generate some 372 megawatthours of electricity a year. 
Noise Control

“Vienna is doing everything it can to keep noise exposure as low as possible 
Noise Exposure in Vienna 
A major city and noise are inextricably linked. 
Vienna is doing everything it can to keep noise exposure as low as possible for the population. 
Measures such as noise control walls, Tempo 30 zones, residential area designations, pedestrian precincts, parking space management and optimal noise control on the metro and tram systems play a crucial role in this connection. 
Nevertheless, noise exposure – as in other cities, too – often remains above the target limits. 
As a result, increasing use is made of unconventional methods as well as tried and tested ones in combating noise.The “Cooperative Noise Remediation” project where people causing noise and those affected by it try to find a solution together or the mediation procedure at Vienna’s airport are cited as representative examples in this connection. 
The basis for reducing environmental noise should also be provided with the help of an EU directive that has been in force for a short period. 
Experts are working on noise maps and action plans across Europe for this purpose. 
The latest computer technology is also providing valuable help in combating noise. 
Inhouse IT programs have been developed for both traffic and rail noise and the Municipal Department for Environmental Protection (MA 22) uses mobile noise measurement equipment to measure noise on the spot. 
Noise is omnipresent in the city as traffic noise, as noise from construction sites or from pubs and restaurants, business establishments or noise from one’s next door neighbours. 
Admittedly the perception of noise is subjective while it is clear that everybody participates in the noise of the city – with some causing noise and others suffering from it. 
In a study carried out by IFES in 2003, 8,300 Viennese over the age of 15 were asked about various issues including noise pollution. 
Compared with a study carried out in 1995, noise pollution at home both during the day and in the evening and at night has remained virtually the same with minor falls of one per cent being recorded in each case. 
The city of Vienna, particularly MA 22, the Municipal Department for Road Management and Construction (MA 28), the Municipal Department for the Inspection of Business Establishments, Electrical and Gas Equipment, Fire Prevention and Official Authorisation of Events (MA 36) and the Municipal Department for Traffic Management and Organisation (MA 46) as well as the Municipal District Offices, is endeavouring through various measures and cooperation on projects to improve the noise situation in terms of road traffic and generally in the city on an ongoing basis. 
These include the following measures: 
• Expanding and upgrading the cycle path network to increase the incentives for using bikes to get to work on the one hand and to make the facilities for cyclists more attractive on the other hand. 
• Continuously extending the Viennese metro network. 
• Planning noise control projects along the roads at municipal level and along railway tracks in collaboration with the federal government. 
• Re-designating streets of houses as designated residential areas or pedestrian precincts and establishing new Tempo 30 zones in the Vienna urban area. 
• Encouraging noise control windows along major A and B routes if the limits are exceeded by more than 60 decibels during the day or more than 50 decibels at night. 
• Using noise reducing road surfaces on road sections that are particularly noisy. 
• Sealing music facilities in accordance with the Veranstaltungs- und Veranstaltungsstättengesetz (Events and Event Venues Act) and in accordance with the Gewerbeordnung (Trade, Commerce and Industry Regulation Act). 
• Involving experts from the Vienna Department for Environmental Protection on noise issues in various administrative procedures (trade processes, construction methods, authorisation of events, etc.). 
• Speeding up public transport with modern transport equipment also contributes to its being a good alternative to using the car. 
• Managing parking space, including reducing the amount of time spent looking for parking spaces. 
Long-Term Noise Control Measures are Effective Many measures, some of which were started as early as the mid-1980s, have contributed successfully to reducing noise pollution for the Viennese in recent years. 
The noise level of cars depends, among other things, on how fast they are driven. 
The lower the speed, the more quietly the car travels. 
As a result, the first Tempo 30 zones covering a distance of 31 kilometres were introduced as early as 1987. 
At the year end 2005, Tempo 30 applied to a total of 1,353.4 kilometres, which is 48 per cent of the entire municipal road network in Vienna. 
Each year, new Tempo 30 zones covering between 20 and 100 kilometres are added. 
In addition, there are 130 designated residential areas and 73 pedestrian precincts. 
The extent of both designated residential areas and pedestrian precincts in Vienna has increased since 2000. 
In 17 of Vienna’s 23 districts there is already at least one pedestrian precinct! 
The positive impact in terms of noise is complemented by the continuous expansion of the cycle path and metro networks as well as the management of parking space. 
This has not only cut the number of vehicles entering the area where parking space is managed by around 16 per cent, it has also sharply reduced the time spent trailing round looking for parking spaces.The installation of noise control windows and sound insulating ventilators also contributes to mitigating the noise of traffic. 
Financial support is available from the Province of Vienna. 
Information on this subject is available from the Municipal Department for Technical and Financial Assessment in Matters of Housing Construction and Promotion, Specialised Urban Renewal (MA 25), on the Internet at http://www.wien.gv.at/ma25/ and by phone from (01) 4000/74870. 
More information on the issue of noise • Brochures on the issue of noise and how to combat it are available free of charge from the folder service offered by Vienna’s environmental hotline, Tel. (01) 4000-8022. 
• Important information is also available on the Internet at www.wien.gv.at/umweltschutz/lois, MA 22’s online noise information system. 
Road Traffic Noise 
In surveys in Vienna, traffic is the most frequently cited source of noise and is perceived by people as being particularly disturbing. 
Great importance is therefore attached to reducing traffic noise in residential areas along heavily used main roads but also with regard to the continuing increase in traffic volumes. 
Low Noise Road Surfaces This is why adequate noise control for the residential population is also included in plans for developing new main roads such as the A 22 – Nordbrücke extension to Lundenburgergasse. 
Admittedly, it is often very difficult to construct noise control walls on existing roads in the densely constructed urban area. 
At the end of the day, improvements in the noise situation can often only be achieved by moving the carriage way away from residential buildings and installing a noise reducing topping. 
The road topping plays a vital role in reducing noise. 
At the speeds normally travelled in the city, the rolling noise of car tyres is the major source of noise. 
The use of coarse-grained surface toppings (e.g. concrete paving with an “exposed aggregate concrete surface” or grainy split mastix asphalt) in the course of upgrading B roads and motorways contributes to keeping vehicle rolling noise down. 
MA 28 installed coarse-grained surface toppings of this kind for example on Untere Donaustraße and Hadikgasse in the period 2004/2005. 
Noise Control Walls There are currently some 8,800 metres of noise control walls with an area of around 31,000 square metres on Vienna’s main B roads. 
In the last two years, two important noise control projects amounting to 1,510 metres in length were implemented at a cost of € 1.25 million in Wientalstraße and in Donaustraße. 
There are currently 56.3 kilometres of noise control walls with an area of around 206,000 square metres along Vienna’s urban motorways. 
New noise control walls were also constructed or existing ones increased in height in 2004/2005 – in total 5,620 metres at a cost of around € 2.44 million. 
In addition, in the period 2004/2005 MA 28 planned noise control walls along the Eastern Motorway, the Nordbrücke extension and the South-East Tangent motorway (Landstraße intersection) amounting to 13,200 metres in length and 46,000 square metres in area at an estimated cost of around € 7 million, which should be constructed or completed in 2006. 
Following tough negotiations in recent years, the construction of the first noise control wall at Theodor-Körner-Hof is also planned for October 2006. 
The “SYLVIELärmschutzwand Theodor-Körner-Hof” project, which was developed within the framework of the EU’s LIFEEnvironment support programme, is to mitigate the noise exposure from rail and road along the Südgürtel and improve the quality of life for people living alongside it. 
Environmental Noise Directive The implementation of the “Environmental Noise Directive” (Directive by the European Council 2002/49/EC on the assessment and abatement of environmental noise) will provide data on the noise situation in conurbations caused by road and rail traffic, aircraft and IPPC facilities (industry) for the first time. 
The following measures are gradually being carried out in this connection: 
• Calculation of the burden imposed by environmental noise using noise maps produced in accordance with common valuation methods for the member states. 
• Informing the public about environmental noise and its effects. 
• Development of action plans by the member states based on the results of the noise maps with the aim of preventing and reducing environmental noise as far as necessary and particularly in cases where the extent of the exposure can be detrimental to health and of maintaining environmental quality in cases in which it is satisfactory. 
The noise maps for the Vienna conurbation, among other areas, are to be drawn up by 2007. They are to be subjected to review at least once every five years (and if necessary revised) and made accessible to the public – probably via the Internet. 
The action plans including appropriate measures to reduce the noise problems are to be worked out by the responsible authorities by 2008. 
They are also to be reviewed and adapted every five years and made accessible to the public. 
Progress is being made on the work needed to implement the Environmental Noise Directive for the city of Vienna. Road Traffic Noise Immissions Land Register Anybody wishing to know how loud the noise from the street outside his house is can check on the Internet at www.wien.gv.at/umweltschutz/lois.This site provides comprehensive information on the subject of noise, including the “Road Traffic Noise Immissions Land Register” (SLIM), which encompasses the entire major road network. 
The database will be extended further in the course of implementing the Environmental Noise Directive. 
Currently, priorities for noise control measures are being set with the help of SLIM. 
The effects of organisational changes to traffic such as relocating traffic or imposing speed limits can be scrutinised this way. 
The data are also used by the Planning Department to issue noise certificates or to calculate the spread of noise under different circumstances. 
In future, the noise maps produced under the EU’s Environmental Noise Directive will be used for this purpose. 
Rail Noise 
According to the “Leben und Lebensqualität in Wien” (Life and Quality of Life in Vienna) study, around nine per cent of the population suffer from noise emanating from trains and wagons moving along rail tracks. 
With this type of noise the sounds are caused by the wheels touching the track and depend on the axle load, the speed of travel, the means of drive operation and from the state of the rails. 
Austria was the first European country to issue noise regulations for rail vehicles in 1993. 
Since then the “Schienenfahrzeug-Lärmzulässigkeitsverordnung” (law regulating noise levels permissible for rail vehicles) has regulated noise emissions by vehicles externally (affecting abutting owners) and internally (affecting passengers). 
In turn, the “Schienenverkehrslärm-Immissionsschutzverordnung” (rail traffic noise – immission control ordinance) limits the noise to which the residential population is exposed. 
Noise Control along Railway Lines Sound immissions on the railway lines in the Viennese urban area operated by the Österreichische Bundesbahen (ÖBB – Austrian Federal Railways) were calculated with the rail traffic noise land register in 1993. 
In 2003, the rail traffic noise emissions land register was evaluated with regard to train data with a forecast of the traffic data for 2016. 
An update of the immissions data along railway lines shown on the register will be available with the noise maps that have been prescribed by law through the implementation of the EU Environmental Noise Directive. 
The data from the land register and in future the noise maps and action plans resulting from the EU Environmental Noise Directive will be used in zoning and development planning and in planning noise control measures for residential buildings on existing railway lines and generally in planning in Vienna. 
In constructing the Leopoldau station noise control wall, the influence of transparent noise control elements was tested in comparison with a highly absorbent model. 
From an urban design and operational viewpoint the use of transparent noise control elements is often demanded, for instance around stations. 
The tests conducted by the Noise Control team at MA 22 were able to demonstrate for the first time from a technical viewpoint that this results in a deterioration of up to five decibels. 
Seven different combinations of transparent elements were tested. 
Plans are in place to repeat the tests under different sound dissemination conditions with ÖBB Bau AG in future. 
Redevelopment of Existing Track Sections in Vienna The project to redevelop existing track sections was started in April 2001 following the agreement between the federal government and the Province of Vienna and provides for the redevelopment of those sections of track that predate the Schienenverkehrslärm-Immissionsschutzverordnung (rail traffic noise – immission control ordinance) coming into force. 
The implementation of the redevelopment measures is based on the rail traffic noise land register (emissions and immissions) on the one hand and on a list of priorities created by MA 22 on the other hand. 
This is based on the federal government’s uniform nationwide criteria, the noise exposure and the number of abutting owners affected. 
By the end of 2005, noise control projects had been completed in the area of the Westbahn (western railway) (a residential home for the blind), at Leopoldau station and along Handelksai (only window grants) as part of the programme to redevelop existing track sections, which is financed 50 per cent by the federal government and 50 per cent by the Province of Vienna (MA 22). 
The rating of the noise control projects is based on the rating sound level of 55 decibels at night. 
Construction work on the Johnstraße to Penzing station and Nordwestbahnhof area (Taborstraße to Stromstraße) projects is planned to start in 2006. 
The execution of the Bahnhof Wien/Nord-Hellwagstraße noise control project is directly linked to the redevelopment of the Wien Nord railway station and the reconstruction of the section up to Traisengasse, which is to be carried out in two phases. 
Apart from the project along the Handelskai, which only involved grants for windows, all the other projects envisage a combination of noise control walls and grants for windows to comply with the rating sound level of 55 decibels at night. 
Plans are also being worked on for the following sections: Südbahn (Atzgersdorf station to the provincial boundary and Einsiedlergasse to Meidlinger Hauptstraße), Westbahn (Ameisgasse to Deutschordensstraße), Wien Nord–Bernhardsthal section (area around Wasserparkbrücke to Werndlgasse), WienSüd–Nickelsdorf (area around Ghegastraße to the ÖBB workshop in Simmering) section and Penzing–Heiligenstadt section (Rankgasse to Wilhelminenstraße). 
Metro and Trams are becoming even Quieter WIENER LINIEN is also focusing increasingly on noise control. 
For example, low-noise wagons with sound insulating aprons and sound absorbing underbodies have been developed for the tram. 
New methods of absorbing the structure-borne noise from the tracks also ensure that less noise penetrates homes situated along the tracks. 
If tracks are to be upgraded or a new section built, the anticipated structure-borne sound emissions in the surrounding homes have been measured as a precaution since 1985. 
If the results are unfavourable, the tracks are laid on a sound absorbing track system. 
Regular maintenance of the tracks involving grinding and/or greasing as well as noise control walls along sections of the metro also lead to less noise being produced. 
Incidentally, the metro is virtually silent when travelling underground. 
Thanks to optimal use of sonic technology in constructing tunnels and track systems, there is virtually no noise. Driving noise is reduced by lining tunnels with sound absorbing material. 
As with road noise, there is a land register showing noise from trams and the metro, which is used when planning and executing sonic remediation measures around WIENER LINIEN’s facilities. 
Noise control will be part of future projects from the outset. 
For example, a comprehensive review of the environmental impact of the extension of the U2 metro line towards Aspern, which is currently under construction, was carried out within the framework of an EIS (environmental impact study). 
Aircraft Noise 
In contrast to road traffic noise where a constant sustained noise is generated by heavy traffic, in the case of aircraft noise each flight movement is perceptible as an individual noise even during periods of heavy traffic. 
Even if the noise does not exhibit a high sound pressure level, it can be clearly distinguished from other sounds through the distinctive turbine or propeller noise. 
Short-term sound peaks occur particularly when taking off and landing. 
Air traffic regulations are the responsibility of the federal government (legislation and execution). 
The current air traffic act contains a whole series of regulations some of which relate to noise control. 
Flughafen Wien AG is committed to dealing with the environment sensibly and with consideration. 
The company focuses on the subjects of noise and pollutant emissions but also on questions of supply and disposal and the efficient use of energy. 
Among other things the “Mediationsverfahren Flughafen Wien” (Mediation Process Vienna Airport) was concluded in 2005 with the official signing of the final documents. 
The negotiations focused on two issues: the problems of aircraft noise with the existing two-runway system and managing the problems of capacity at Vienna International Airport in future. 
Representatives of action groups, Flughafen Wien AG, Austrian Airlines Group, Austro Control, the political parties, from authorities and lobbies as well as the mayors of the surrounding municipalities worked out common solutions. 
“Dialogue Forum Vienna International Airport” Established The “Current Measures” subagreement on the issue of aircraft noise was signed in May 2003. 
Work on the issue of the future was also concluded on 22 June 2005. 
The final documents contain a summary of the results, which were signed by 55 parties to the mediation process, and legally binding agreements.They define the position of a third runway, record the agreed framework conditions such as night flight regulations, noise caps and technical noise control as well as the payments to environmental funds and the dialogue forum and so provide the basis for further concerted action. 
The “Dialogue Forum Vienna International Airport” association was established immediately after the end of the mediation process. 
It has the task of continuing the dialogue from the mediation process and of discussing issues that emerge from current developments. 
The aim of the association is to involve all those affected in the discussion process if possible. 
More information is available on the Internet at www.viemediation.at or at www.vie-umwelt.at. 
FANOMOS Measures Flight Noise FANOMOS (Flight Track and Noise Monitoring System) is an important tool for monitoring current flight movements. 
It measures flight noise immissions and records the flight track, speed and height of all planes in conjunction with radar data. 
In 2005, 31 mobile measuring series were carried out in addition to the results from the 14 fixed measuring stations.The results were published in the evaluation report of the dialogue forum. 
Under the European Council’s Directive 92/14/EEC only “chapter 3” aircraft (defined in Annex 16 of the Agreement of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)) may take off and land in Vienna. 
Types of aircraft that are louder, “chapter 2” aircraft and below require a certificate of exemption. 
Since the beginning of 2004, the info line “Environment and Aviation” (0810 22 33 44) has been available for complaints about air traffic. 
“Cooperative Noise Remediation” 
The city of Vienna has adopted another approach to noise remediation with the SYLVIE project. 
The project, which was carried out by the Municipal Department for Environmental Protection (MA 22) within the framework of the EU’s LIFE-Environment 1999 support programme, has investigated the influence of citizen involvement in addition to the focus on technology in noise remediation. 
Further information is available on the Internet at www.sylvie.at. 
Experience has shown that great success can be achieved in cases of conflict through the willingness of those involved in the action. 
As the conflict about noise becomes more complex, the room for manoeuvre is reduced. 
In 2004, MA 22 provided financial assistance to a successor project to SYLVIE in Schleifmühlgasse in the 4th district under the project name “Cooperative Noise Remediation at District Level”. 
The aim was to work out solutions for the differing interests of abutting owners, pub operators and in connection with the summer festival that takes place every year in Schleifmühlgasse. 
MA 22 will continue to provide technical support for any future cooperative noise remediation processes, however, they will have to be financed through the districts or by other means.

Growth and prosperity are closely associated with mobility – but not with the car 
Transport Policy 
Transport policy is constantly caught between the conflicting interests of the economy and ecology but no system other than that of an efficient and socially-aware public transport system, as operated by WIENER LINIEN, is better at balancing these interests. 
Even when considered in purely economic terms, no other strategy offers a more efficient means of fulfilling the need for mobility while simultaneously reducing energy consumption and emissions that are harmful to the environment; a real winwin situation for both parties! 
However, for many people mobility means car-based mobility and for many road users their own comfort and the costs associated with their chosen means of travel are more important than protecting the environment. 
Only in situations where these criteria are clearly perceptible in connection with public transport are people prepared to go without their cars. 
The concept of Least Cost Transportation Planning was developed by the research association CITY:mobil, which consists of five Austrian and German institutions or companies, in order to create the basis for sounder transport policy decisions by improving the procedures for evaluating the true costs of all forms of mobility. 
These researchers hypothesised that, “Ecological benefits are also to be expected from a more efficient transport system that is managed according to more stringent economic criteria.” In the course of a similar investigation, data from 100 of the world’s leading cities – including Vienna and Graz in Austria – were collected by the International Union of Public Transport (UITP). 
The most important of its results was that the higher the proportion of cars in fulfilling the individuals’ demand for mobility, the higher the costs for the world at large. 
By comparison these densely inhabited cities with more than 20 inhabitants per hectare, where more than 50 per cent of mobility takes place on foot, by bicycle or with public transport, account for only five to seven per cent of GDP. 
In less densely inhabited, scattered urban areas, where most mobility takes place by car, the costs that accrue to the world at large from urban transport can rise to up to 15 per cent of GDP. 
Public transport, which consumes four times less energy per passenger kilometre, is also far more cost effective than the car, not including the fact that it takes up less space. 
Car Free Day The Car Free Day has been a fixed component of European transport policy since 1998. 
In 2004 and 2005, MA 46 again coordinated many public events with current developments in the traffic situation. 
Among other things, attention was drawn constantly to the current traffic situation via MA 46’s live traffic reports and the traffic reports’ portal run by the Institut für Verkehrsinformation (Institute for Traffic Information). 
This means that important information could be passed directly to the Viennese so that virtually no obstructions had to be announced. 
In urban conurbations, public transport is undisputedly the most economically effective means of fulfilling the demand for mobility – and at the same time the most environmentally friendly. 
WIENER LINIEN is proving to be a sustainable answer to the problems of transport that are now discussed throughout the world. 
In 2004, WIENER LINIEN transported some 735 million passengers, which means that each of the capital’s inhabitants used public transport for some 460 journeys. 
Another record was achieved in 2005 with around 746 million journeys. 
This means that around 11.5 million more passengers travelled with WIENER LINIEN in 2005 than in the previous year! 
More than 313,000 Viennese have had an annual travel card since 2005, which means that one in four of the capital’s adult inhabitants holds this type of travel card. 
With a market share of more than 34 per cent of all journeys made by the Viennese, WIENER LINIEN ranks as one of the leading urban transport companies in Europe. 
If one simply compares these two figures with a corresponding number of individual car journeys, it is clear that WIENER LINIEN signifies environmental protection and improved quality of life for every Viennese. 
One and a Half Million Fewer Car Journeys a Day Travelling by car is expensive, stressful and harms the environment. 
Despite this, growth in miles travelled is rising sharply in Austria, particularly in terms of passenger traffic. 
In Austria, just over 100 billion “road passenger kilometres” were covered in 2000, of which more than two thirds were in motorised individual traffic (car, moped, motorbike). 
Average motor vehicle occupancy in urban areas amounts to 1.2 people. 
Without the services of WIENER LINIEN we would have more than 1.5 million more car journeys on Vienna’s streets. 
And – to be able to move on them – we would need to build a further ten South-East “Tangent” motorways! 
In any case, the services of WIENER LINIEN ensure the functional efficiency of traffic in and around Vienna and allow business logistics chains to remain uninterrupted, thus saving costs. 
Investigations by the Verkehrsclub Österreich (VCÖ – Austrian Automobile Association) show that the annual amount of time spent waiting in traffic in Vienna amounts to 240 hours per person on average. 
This results in congestion costs of €1.84 billion per year. 
The Metro Network is to be Expanded Further The metro is by far the most popular and – in terms of growth in passenger numbers – most successful means of inner-city travel. 
When the metro extensions covered by the third phase of expansion (U1-Nord, U2-Nord as far as Aspernstraße) are commissioned in 2008, the Viennese metro network will be some 75 kilometres long and will encompass around 100 stations. 
When extending the lines and expanding the network, those sections that indicate sufficient potential for further urban development or make a major contribution to improving the modalsplit, particularly for people from outside Vienna, are given priority. 
The following metro projects from the third and fourth phases of expansion should be commissioned in the next ten years: 
• By autumn 2006 the extension of the U1 line to Leopoldau. 
• By May 2008 the extension of the U2 to the Ernst-Happel Stadium, by 2010 to Aspernstraße and by 2013 to Aspern airfield. 
• By 2015 the extension of the U1-Süd into the Rothneusiedl area. 
From past experience gained in metro construction, WIENER LINIEN expect that, if citizens are sufficiently involved, accepted and generally satisfactory solutions to the issues of designing the surface can be found once the construction work is finished. 
This is why the concerns of the population are assimilated and taken into account accordingly in terms of function in particular. 
With regard to connecting the existing road network or planned cycle paths or footpaths, the new metro stations to be built constitute important links for those seeking rest and relaxation. 
The station areas are designed to take account of these circumstances. 
To reduce noise levels around over ground stations, all stations along the U2 extension will be covered over. 
The station buildings will be constructed using bird-resistant glass and the roofs will be planted. 
To improve infrastructure links, sufficient parking space for bicycles is planned at every station. 
In addition, appropriate steps will be taken to improve links with the cycle and foot paths around each station that form part of the city’s leisure network. 
Through a variety of organisational, operational and structural measures, the Viennese metro’s safety system, which has proved its worth for more than three decades and is maintained in line with the latest technical developments, ensures that this important means of travel operates safely and in an environmentally friendly manner. 
“ULF” and Co are focusing on Environmental Protection At the beginning of the 1960s, WIENER LINIEN began using liquefied petroleum gas as fuel for its buses. 
Today, all its buses have liquefied petroleum gas engines. 
Unlike diesel buses, liquefied petroleum gas buses are particularly environmentally friendly. 
Thanks to its simple chemical structure, liquefied petroleum gas burns extremely cleanly and produces virtually no soot. 
Emissions of nitrogen oxides from liquefied petroleum gas buses are also lower than from diesel buses thanks to the use of regulated three-way catalytic converters. 
WIENER LINIEN has therefore equipped all its buses with catalytic converters, even before it was obliged to do so by law. 
It has, of course, kept to this strategy of using liquefied petroleum gas engines with lambda sensors and three-way catalytic converters with the new generation of low floor buses and has consequently taken a crucial step into the future. 
As a result, Vienna has one of the best drive concepts for minimumemissions passenger transportation in urban areas. 
The figures for emissions are not only well below the EURO IV norm for exhaust emissions currently in force but the EURO V norm, which comes into effect in 2008. They also fall below the EEV (environmental enhanced vehicles) norm. 
They will even fall below EEV/2 with the newly developed liquefied petroleum gas engines, which have been used in all new vehicles since the end of 2005. 
A study by Gerd Sammer (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU) Vienna) shows that using liquefied petroleum gas to operate the bus fleet saved a total of 55 tonnes CO, 21 tonnes HC, 219 tonnes NOx and 17 tonnes of particles compared with using diesel in 2001. 
No other engine is as environmentally friendly! 
Orders were placed for a further 90 low floor buses in 2005. 
They will be delivered on a phased basis up to 2009. 
As a result, it will be possible to convert the entire bus fleet to low floor vehicles by mid-2007. 
The “ULF” (ultra low floor) tram, which was introduced eight years ago, having been developed together with the new company Siemens SGP Verkehrstechnik, is also a multitalented vehicle and combines benefits for passengers and the environment: 
An entirely new, computer controlled mono-wheel suspension provides the world’s lowest access height – a mere 19 centimetres above street level – in a tram! 
Since the tram gets by without any axles between the wheels, there are no steps or obstacles inside the tram either. 
However, ULF also stands for energy-saving travel and, in addition to active current heating, also has the option of feeding energy back into the network. 
Currently there are more than 150 ULFs in operation on WIENER LINIEN’s tram network. 
By introducing energy efficient driving via the scheduling computer located in the central metro control centre, savings of some seven per cent of the traction electricity needed have been achieved throughout the operation. 
In this connection, a scheduling computer regulates the train’s speed to ensure that it arrives promptly at the next stop. 
This means that every time passengers enter or leave the trains more quickly than envisaged in the timetable, the speed can be reduced to reflect this. 
Since we are only talking about seconds here, this approach is scarcely perceptible to passengers. 
Since the end of 2005, the following vehicles or vehicle types, which can return braking energy to the network, have been available: 
117 rotary current double-engine cars from the second generation of Viennese metro power cars, 34 modernised double engine cars from the first generation, a type V train, i.e. from the new third generation, 78 Type T vehicles for line U6 and 152 low floor trams (ULF) of types A and B. Energy savings in terms of the traction required can also be expected in future. 
Up to 2009, 40 double engine metro cars from the first generation will be converted to rotary current and will consequently be modernised significantly. 
In 2006, the first Type V series-production vehicles will be commissioned, in 2009, 48 U6 Type E6 vehicles are to be swapped for 38 Type T1 vehicles. 
By 2014, a further 150 low floor (UFL) trams will replace the Type E1 articulated trams. 
Ecological Supervision for Construction of the Lainzer Tunnel A construction project of the size of the Lainzer Tunnel cannot be constructed entirely without impacting on nature even in a major city like Vienna. 
However, in order to keep the impact as low as possible, ÖBBInfrastruktur Bau AG has developed a programme of ecological supervision to accompany the construction of the entire project. 
In addition, an ecological monitoring programme was provided by law for those Wiental flood detention basins that were affected by the project. 
Alternative Mobility 
Cycling Becomes More and More Attractive A Package of Measures: 
Cycle Traffic 2000 Travelling to work, school or the shops by bike is becoming more and more attractive. 
Particularly over short distances of up to five kilometres and “from door to door”, bikes score highly as a means of travel that is environmentally friendly and compatible with city life and as a method of transportation. 
Since 1 January 2003, money has again been provided from the city’s central budget to expand the city-wide primary network of cycle paths. 
Apart from the funds provided from the city’s central budget, the 23 Viennese districts also provide funds for specific projects. 
At the end of 2005, the Viennese network of cycle paths covered a distance of more than 1,000 kilometres. 
On average over the past two years, 50 kilometres of new cycling infrastructure has been added each year. 
Old cycling facilities have also been upgraded to match modern standards. 
The aim of the “Transport Master Plan” is to double the proportion of cycle traffic in the city by 2010. 
For this purpose, the Municipal Department for Urban Development and Planning (MA 18) and the Municipal Department for Traffic Management and Organisation (MA 46) have developed a comprehensive scheme – consisting of a programme to close gaps, to open oneway streets to cycle traffic, to plan and construct facilities for parking bikes as well as establishing “soft policy measures” such as marketing activities and information campaigns – and have begun implementing it. 
Programme to Close Gaps in the Cycle Path Network A cycle path construction programme is drawn up every year by MA 18, the Municipal Department for Road Management and Construction (MA 28) and MA 46 and coordinated with measures being taken at district level. 
In implementing the principal cycle path network, particular attention is paid to ensuring that there is no mixing of pedestrian and cycle traffic if possible but either independent cycle paths are constructed or cycle traffic is integrated with individual motorised traffic at the same level. 
When looking at road projects, checks are carried out as to whether sufficient account has been taken of cyclists’ interests and, if necessary, requests for specific changes are incorporated in the project. 
In the medium term, around €6 million will be made available each year for the expansion of the cycle path network. 
Marketing Since the Internet is becoming increasingly important as a communications system, a platform has been created to provide information on measures to promote cycle traffic. 
As a result, attention is drawn to the construction programme for the respective year and sensible tips on using one’s bike and the cycle path network at district level are provided at http://www.wien.at/verkehr/radfahren/ index.htm. 
Since 2005, the current cycle path network has been available on this website as a particular highlight. 
Here, you have the option of obtaining local, district-wide or city-wide information via the Internet or choosing an individual cycle route. 
Folders about new cycling facilities have also been printed and made available free of charge. 
City-Bike Building on the experience gained in the “Vienna Bike – Free City-Bike” project, GEWISTA presented a new scheme for the provision of free bikes together with the city of Vienna at the beginning of 2003.The scheme envisages that pick-up points with free bikes will be provided within a radius of 800 metres.The area to be served in this way is bounded by the Gürtel roadway and the Donaukanal. 
By 2005, 48 pick-up points were in place. 
Before one of the bikes can be taken for personal use, the user of this system must identify him or herself by credit card, Visa or MasterCard or by means of an ATM card. 
The relevant instructions for use are also available in English, French and Italian. 
During the first hour, travel along all the city’s streets on the City-Bike is free. 
A fee is payable for its use from the second hour. 
The terminals are linked to each other and to a central monitoring station. 
A team ensures that the respective stations have the correct number of bikes – neither too few nor too many. 
Electronically stored data on the time, duration and frequency with which bikes are hired and on the distribution of the bikes is available. 
The fact that the scheme is not anonymous helps to counter vandalism and theft. 
Tempo 30 Zones The Transport Master Plan 2003 aims to create a contiguous Tempo 30 zone in the densely populated city of Vienna. 
As a result, Tempo 30 should become the rule and higher speeds the exception. 
The districts are responsible for implementing this measure. 
In September 2005, area-wide Tempo 30 zones were announced for the 7th and 8th districts. 
Streets with public transport (PT) and parts of the primary road network are excluded. 
As part of the project the 30 kilometre limit applying solely to the Mariahilfer Straße in the 7th district was suspended and a Tempo 30 zone covering the whole area was announced. 
Generally, the main road network for motorised individual traffic (MIT) is excluded from the 30 kilometres per hour rule. 
In individual cases MIT main roads may also be integrated in Tempo 30 zones. 
Conversely those PT streets on which public transport may travel faster than 30 kilometres per hour should be exempted from the 30 kilometres per hour rule. 
Tempo 30 zones have already been created in the 22nd district as part of a pilot project and public transport has been exempted from these. 
Should this pilot project prove its worth, it is conceivable that it will be extended to other parts of Vienna. 
The city of Vienna is extending the Tempo 30 zones in close consultation with the districts in order not just to increase road safety but also to reduce the emissions to which the population is exposed. 
The improvements in safety for cyclists resulting from the adjustment in speed levels in Tempo 30 zones not only avoids substantial investment in separate cycling facilities but also keeps our narrow streets free for other uses. 
According to statements by MA 46, the 30 kilometres-per-hour network was expanded to 1,191 kilometres in 2004 and 2005. 
Operational Mobility Management In the city of Vienna’s climate protection programme (KliP) and the new Transport Master Plan 2003 “Mobile in Vienna” the chapter on mobility management is particularly important. 
In essence, it is a case of using the transport infrastructure more efficiently. 
Clear targets and actions have accordingly been defined under the motto “Mobilität mit System” (systematic mobility). 
In 2004, a pilot project was carried out with the Administrative Group Planning, Traffic and Transport, MA 18 (project management) and the offices affected in the Niederhofstraße district town hall (Municipal Department for Architecture and Urban Design (MA 19), MA 46, WIENER WOHNEN). 
It involved working out an operational mobility concept focused on the district town hall, which will subsequently serve as the basis for working out the measures in detail and implementing them. 
The aims are to reduce the proportion of journeys by car (official cars), increase the proportion of environmentally friendly transport modes used for official travel, increase the number of people cycling to work, reduce emissions when travelling to work (especially CO2) and to make staff more aware of alternative forms of mobility. 
Commercial Traffic 
The Port of Vienna The Port of Vienna, which is situated in the east of the city, is the largest goods distribution centre in the Vienna Region having turned over 4.5 million tonnes of goods in 2005. 
Of this figure, 1.7 million tonnes are transported on inland navigation vessels. 
This equates to approximately 85,000 fully laden lorries, which means that this volume of goods is able to reach the region – even over long distances – in a manner that is less harmful to the environment. 
In 2005, more than 224,000 container units (TEU) were handled in the Freudenau container terminal, thus providing an impressive demonstration of the port’s leading position in seaport container traffic. 
Since the majority of the containers are transported onwards by rail, this reduces the amount of traffic on the roads accordingly! 
In the course of extending the Freudenau combi terminal (which is currently in the planning stage), the railway bridge over the port entry is to be rebuilt, thus linking the port area with the Kledering central marshalling yard. 
This will increase the efficiency of the combined transport as a whole and consequently improve competitiveness. 
The infrastructure in the Freudenau, Albern and Lobau ports fulfils the requirements of a modern handling centre and is being constantly improved in ecological terms. 
Thanks to the speed with which goods can be transferred between ships, rail and lorries, the port offers businesses the preconditions needed to switch to combined transport. 
“GüterBim” (Cargo Tram) Project The project for conveying goods within the city using the existing rail network (GüterBim) investigated the infrastructure related preconditions for operating a cargo tram in Vienna. 
The aim was to use the existing, welldeveloped public transport network to switch goods traffic from the roads to rail. 
The project was promoted by the Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology. 
Together with WIENER LINIEN, Wiener Lokalbahnen and Vienna Consult, the project management team of TINA Vienna Transport Strategies investigated all the systems needed to operate a cargo tram and its logistical application potential. 
Since summer 2005, the people of Vienna have got used to seeing the “GüterBim” on the streets regularly. 
The success of the project has aroused the interest of the business community and caused the project team to develop follow-up projects. 
These are to take account of potential customers’ specific requirements, press ahead with the development of prototypes and create synergies with existing city logistic projects. 
In any case, the “GüterBim” will go into regular operation within a maximum of three years and contribute to a sustainable, environmentally friendly transport policy that reflects the aims of the Kyoto Protocol and the EU Transport white paper. 
Disposal Logistics by Rail The Guidelines for Sustainable Construction Site Management (RUMBA) project, which was 40 per cent subsidised by the EU’s “LIFE” development programme, ran in Vienna until November 2004. 
Among other things, RUMBA sought to reduce the number of transports and to switch transports from lorries to other forms of transport. 
The project also encouraged the presorting of residual building materials at the building site as well as taking account of noise levels, emissions of pollutants and light pollution during the construction project. 
The rationale behind the project lay in the fact that currently some 99 per cent of Viennese goods’ traffic is handled by road – resulting in correspondingly high pollutant emissions, noise levels and greater wear and tear on roads. 
Three demonstration projects looking at the issues of building site traffic, presorted collection of residual building materials at building sites and environmentally friendly building management and logistics were carried out within the framework of RUMBA. 
Together with experience gathered previously these formed the basis for a code of practice. 
The projects were implemented in the cities of Vienna and Graz but can also be transferred to other communes and construction projects. 
More information is available from the Internet: www.rumba-info.at. 
A further project that corresponds precisely with the objectives of RUMBA was dealt with in collaboration with the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) in 2005. 
A modern housing development is currently under construction on the grounds of Kabel- und Drahtwerke AG in Wien-Meidling. 
Entsorgungs Logistik Austria GmbH (ELA), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ÖBB, was tasked with organising the transport logistics and with disposing of the excavation material. 
All materials were transported by rail. 
The reduction in HGV traffic this achieved reduced the burden on the city’s road network and led to a reduction in airborne pollutants, greenhouse gas and noise emissions. 
During a period of 155 working days, 131,048 tonnes of excavation material were removed and recycled in an environmentally compatible manner. 
By removing it by rail, the city of Vienna and neighbouring owners were spared some 16,380 journeys by lorry, which amounts to around 100 lorry trips per day! 
Car Traffic 
Parking Space Policy As a result of the parking space management programme introduced in 1994, traffic in districts the 1st to 9th districts and 20th district has been reduced through the decrease in the numbers of people parking long-term and those looking for parking spaces, which has improved the amount of parking space available for residents. 
At the same time the Viennese Garage Programme was developed, under which 160 commercial garages offering around 50,000 parking spaces were constructed by the end of 2003. 
The idea of cheaper parking for residents has been implemented with the special “Volksgaragen” (People’s Garages) programme. 
Parking space policy aims to make a contribution to increasing the scope for structuring and using public streets. 
New urban areas are to be designed to meet the needs of pedestrians and high quality standards from the outset. 
Sufficient parking spaces are to be provided both for residents’ cars and for vehicles owned by local businesses – sufficient to meet their commercial requirements. 
On the other hand, this parking space policy aims to reduce the amount of lorry traffic. 
In order to achieve or maintain a high quality of life in densely populated urban areas, we aim, in principle, to shift long-term parking from roads to garages or private parking spaces. 
Parking space caps for businesses, office blocks and shopping centres, as are the norm in many European cities, are one option for achieving this aim. 
Currently, the building code prescribes minimum numbers of parking spaces in Vienna but no maximum. 
In 2005, BOKU produced a study on “instruments to manage the supply of parking spaces for target traffic” (INSTELLA) on behalf of Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland. 
It showed that measures such as the introduction of parking space caps, compulsory parking space charges for operators or users of customer or company parking spaces and setting quotas for trips combined with mobility management measures have the designed effect of reducing car traffic – if they are implemented consistently. 
They promote the development of compact urban structures and make car-focused urban sprawl more difficult. 
In 2006, concrete implementation proposals are to be drawn up for Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland and experiences with parking space caps and group garages are to be presented as part of an international specialist event. 
Road Construction MA 28 – is responsible for the planning, construction and maintenance of all public traffic areas in Vienna. 
Currently, there are around 2,800 kilometres of roads in Vienna, which constantly have to be adapted to users’ changing demands and requirements. 
Taking account of environmental protection is a major challenge in the day-to-day work of staff at MA 28. 
In line with the targets laid down in the Transport Master Plan 2003 and in the Climate Protection Programme, more provision is made for nonmotorised traffic in the course of detailed road planning. 
In so doing, particular attention is attached to the provision of sufficient pedestrian precincts and the consideration of cycling facilities. 
Separate rails for trams and bus lanes accelerate public transport. 
The construction of protruding bus stops for trams and buses thus allowing people to board and alight at the same level not only makes a major contribution to passenger comfort, it also allows people in wheelchairs or with prams to use public transport for the first time! 
Thanks to these and many other measures relating to road construction by MA 28, the framework conditions for environmentally friendly forms of transport in Vienna are improved and additional incentives to switch to environmentally friendly transport modes are provided. 
It is, above all, a large number of small measures that improves the framework conditions for travelling on foot in Vienna. 
These include, most importantly, widening pavements in narrow secondary alleys and creating “secure areas” at junctions and other pedestrian crossings. 
The public focuses more on more substantial road redevelopments such as measures to revitalise shopping streets. 
These measures may include redevelopment as a pedestrian precinct, pavement-widening, the creation of additional pedestrian crossings to allow people to cross the road in safety but also by redesigning urban spaces to regain public space for pedestrians. 
In 2004/2005, the following areas, namely Opernring/Operngasse, Jasomirgottstraße, Messeplatz, Wiedner Hauptstraße, Favoritenstraße, Schönbrunner Schloßbrücke and Wallensteinplatz were redesigned and made more pedestrian-friendly by MA 28. 
The target of increasing the proportion of cycle traffic to eight per cent by 2010 was set in the Transport Master Plan. 
A range of measures – in particular, extending the cycle path network – are needed to achieve this target. 
Many gaps in the cycle path network were closed through the construction of new cycle paths, such as in Lothringerstraße, Nordbahnstraße, Am Heumarkt, Marxergasse, Wiedner Hauptstraße or in Brunner Straße in 2004/2005. 
The 1,000th kilometre of cycle path was opened in Vivariumstraße in Vienna’s 2nd district in autumn 2005! 
Environmental Protection in Road Construction More consideration is given to issues of environmental protection not just in detailed road planning but also in road construction itself. 
For example, account is taken of important environmental criteria in the conditions attached to invitations to tender. 
These relate, for example, to the use of environmentally friendly materials and recycled materials. 
The guiding principle behind the Ökokauf project relating to the recycling/disposal of excavation and demolition material has been included in MA 28’s relevant standard specification of services. 
The extent to which construction materials – particularly bituminous construction materials, which must be “hot” at the construction site – have to be transported is used as a selection criterion for closed award procedures or is considered as an additional criterion for special open award procedures. 
Dust emissions constitute a further important environmental problem in the case of road construction projects involving the movement of large quantities of earth. 
Here, MA 28 obliges the construction company carrying out the work to reduce dust levels by regularly spraying water on the earth in dry or windy weather. 
The City Administration Working for a Better Environment

Exemplary Environmental Protection 
» The City of Vienna Buys “Green” 
As a major customer for “green” products, Vienna has a market position that it seeks to exploit to the best of its ability 
Public Facilities and Official Buildings 
The city of Vienna does a great deal to operate the city administration’s buildings in an as environmentally aware manner as possible. 
The use of environmental management systems ensures that ecological improvements and cost savings are achieved continuously – in municipal offices just as much as in nursery schools or schools. 
And as a major purchaser of environmentally friendly products, the city has a market power that should make a substantial contribution to the development of ecologically compatible products and to an expansion in the range available. 
The criteria for the city of Vienna’s ecological procurement and tendering process are being constantly developed from the EcoBuy Vienna project, which was established in 1998 as part of the Climate Protection Programme (KliP). 
The city’s environmentally relevant measures carry weight! 
Because nursery schools, schools, municipal departments, district offices, social and leisure facilities such as swimming pools or sports facilities are all located in buildings in which every effort is made to manage them ecologically: from heating and rehabilitation to lighting and even to purchasing as well as avoiding waste and disposing of it. 
Energy Savings Performance Contracting The aim of energy savings performance contracting is to make better use of the energy used in a building or an installation. 
An energy savings performance contracting project may include measures of all kinds to increase energy efficiency. 
The only framework condition is that the measures must be paid for from the energy costs saved within a foreseeable period. 
Conversely this means that since the contracting partner’s services are paid from the energy costs saved, the client does not incur any expenditure! 
The Hirschstetten flower gardens project, which was given an Energy Globe Award in 2004, was outstanding in the first implementation phase. 
The project was carried out by the Municipal Department for Building and Facility Management (MA 34) on behalf of the Municipal Department for Parks and Gardens (MA 42). 
In this project, which runs over a period of around 14 years, 395 tonnes of CO2 emissions and consequently € 204,000 in energy costs are saved every year. 
With energy savings performance contracting projects in municipal offices, schools and nursery schools, the city is acting to protect the climate! 
MA 34 has set itself the target of improving the energy efficiency of around 30 of the city’s buildings every year. 
Further examples of this means of optimising energy consumption are provided by the Simmering indoor swimming pool and a further seven municipal swimming pools. 
In essence, the measures taken focused on optimising existing technical equipment, installing solar panels and heat recovery facilities as well as adopting water management measures. 
As the Municipal Department for Municipal Swimming Pools (MA 44) reports some 4,700 square metres of solar collectors have been installed under energy savings performance contracts. 
There are 12,800 square metres of solar collectors installed and operating in municipal swimming pools. 
Bundesimmobiliengesellschaft has installed a contracting model for two pools of 23 Viennese state schools each. 
Following an EU-wide two phase negotiating process, the bidding consortium made up of ENERGIECOMFORT and Siemens was commissioned for one of the two pools with a savings guarantee of 21.1 per cent. 
The WIEN ENERGIE subsidiary will look after 18 Viennese schools for a period of ten years – provisionally up to 2008. 
The European record for public sector property pools was achieved with savings of 21.9 per cent of energy costs! 
The bidding consortium has already been given the contracting award of the “ Austrian Society for the Environment and Technology (ÖGUT) for its success in motivating users. 
ENERGIECOMFORT has so far achieved an average savings ratio of around 22 per cent and a peak value of 24.8 per cent. 
In February 2005, the energy savings performance contracting project for the Paulusgasse Primary School was reviewed. 
In future, this school will use 46 per cent less energy than it did before! 
At the same time, the comfort of the teachers and pupils and the value of the building have been increased by the facilities being modernised. 
Incidentally, a new tender collection process was also developed for contracting in the Paulusgasse Primary School pilot project (see the “Vienna and Europe” chapter), which facilitates high quality bids and at the same time keeps the administrative expenditure for the city of Vienna as the building owner within limits. 
A point-based evaluation method was also developed, which makes it easier to compare the different bids and select the best one using the net present value method. 
The methods developed in the pilot project will also be used in future invitations to tender for contracts by the city of Vienna. 
The beneficial (in terms of budgets) method of energy savings performance contracts has also allowed energy costs to be minimised in a few nursery schools, the most recent being at Auer-Welsbach-Park in the 15th district. 
The new children’s daycare facility at Schukowitzgasse 87 in the 22nd district was also designed as a low energy building by the Municipal Department for Nursery Schools (MA 10) in collaboration with the Municipal Department for Architecture and Urban Design (MA 19). 
The use of energy efficiency optimising technologies was one of the conditions of tender in a competition. 
Constant Ecological Management MA 34 constantly tries to manage the properties for which it is responsible ecologically. 
In the period 2004/2005, among other things • the heating systems in the schools at Darwingasse 14, Pazmanitengasse 26 and Vereinsgasse 29 were converted from oil to district heat; • the heating system at the school at Plankenmaisstraße 30 was also converted from oil to district heat as part of its general modernisation; • the gas heating system at the municipal office/Lycée Français school at Grinzinger Straße 96 was converted to a gas-fired condensing boiler with a flue; • the heating system in the municipal office at Viehmarktgasse 5–7 was converted from oil to district heat; • solar panels were installed in two nursery schools at Endergasse 1 and Johann-Hörbiger-Gasse 43 and • the gas heating system in the MAG ELF-Lindenhof training centre at Pulkauerstraße 43, A-3730 Lindenhof was converted and connected to the Eggenburg district heat network (heated by wood chippings). 
The loft in the “Wiener Wohnen” building in municipal office 1, Bartensteinblock, was extended and increased in height. 
In so doing, the roof areas created on the courtyard side by the new building have provided an ideal opportunity for a large inner-city project to install an innovative photovoltaic plant.This measure should at least cover the electricity needed to cool the conference rooms and to shade and ventilate the offices. 
A total of 420 solar panels acting as a photovoltaic plant will help to improve the building’s energy budget using solar power. 
With a solar area of more than 470 square metres the project is the largest photovoltaic roof plant in Vienna. 
Calculations show that yields totalling between 32,000 and 34,500 kilowatts per year are to be expected, which could result in savings of between € 4,000 and € 4,500 per year. 
Ecological Criteria in School Construction The Municipal Department for School Administration (MA 56) carries out a range of environmentally relevant activities both in the ongoing maintenance of state-sector school buildings and in their general redevelopment as well as in new buildings. 
These include, among other things, exchanging windows for a wood and aluminium structure with a protective coating against the sun on the outside, constructing façades with full thermal insulation, using low-energy light bulbs and concluding energy savings performance contracts. 
When building new state-sector schools, measures are taken to reduce CO2 by controlling the classroom ventilation. 
Care is also taken to use environmentally friendly materials (wooden floors, water-soluble paints, PVC-free floor coverings etc.). 
School buildings are increasingly connected to the district heat network and green areas are created. 
As a rule the Municipal Department for Procurement (MA 54) is responsible for purchasing materials (e.g. cleaning agents, pens and pencils). 
In the invitation to tender for the service of providing staff to distribute meals (including cleaning the kitchen at all-day schools in Vienna) carried out in 2004, it was stipulated that the cleaning agents used by the contractor must be environmentally friendly and the washing active substances must be biologically degradable. 
They had to be used in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines. 
In addition, only those cleaners and coating agents that did not contain certain substances or not above the concentration specified were to be used for deep cleaning. 
On 27 January 2005, the Municipal Council adopted a new regulation for school meals specifying that from the academic year 2005/2006 meals at statesector all-day schools had to contain at least 30 per cent organic ingredients. 
In this connection, each of these schools has been supplied by the school meal caterer of their choice since the previous September. 
Currently, some 19,000 meals are distributed every day at 90 school locations. 
On the basis of inspections in accordance with the stringent rules in the list of criteria, four companies offering frozen and/or chilled food were included in the pool of companies for the academic year 2005/2006. 
In 2005, work started on exchanging cathode ray tube screens for energy saving flat screens. 
By 2007, some 12,000 flat screens, which use around half the energy of a traditional cathode ray tube screen, should be installed in statesector schools. 
When constructing the new Hertha Firnberg School at Wienerberg on the southern edge of Vienna, a primary school with nine classes and a nursery with five groups, a controlled ventilation system involving an upstream ground collector and heat recovery was installed for the first time in a Viennese school. 
The air is pre-heated through geothermal heat in winter and cooled in summer. 
Measurements taken in advance have shown that the CO2 content in classrooms increases after 20 minutes of teaching and pupils’ ability to concentrate falls rapidly. 
The ventilation system in the school, which was completed in September 2005 and which was installed on behalf of MA 56, guarantees constantly perfect air quality and low operating costs. 
Thermally insulated structural components ensure that the building meets low energy standards. 
Environmental Awareness in Managing Nursery Schools Pedagogically speaking a nursery school that is managed in an environmentally aware manner is distinguished by an exemplary attitude, the use of environmentally friendly, toys, painting materials and tools as well as environmentally aware purchasing. 
The socalled BIOBOX has been available in all Viennese nursery schools since December 2004. 
It was developed by EcoBuy Vienna in close collaboration with the educationalists in MA 10 and staff from the Municipal Department for Environmental Protection (MA 22) and the environmental consultants as a package of materials for teaching children. 
The BIOBOX contains various games, a CD of animal sounds and a handbook with models to copy, suggestions and recipes. 
Children are introduced to the topic of healthy eating through play and learn the difference between traditional and organic farming. 
Since the beginning of 2003, healthier food with a high proportion of organically produced raw materials has been served in the city of Vienna’s crèches, nursery schools and nurseries. 
The innovation – which affects some 26,000 snacks and 30,000 hot and cold meals respectively – has been welcomed equally by children and parents. 
As a result, Vienna is setting international standards in the procurement of environmentally friendly and sustainable products. 
And without charging the parents any more. 
Currently the proportion of organic products amounts to 50 per cent on average. 
This means that Vienna is the only city in Europe offering such a high proportion of organic food in its children’s meals! 
In addition to transporting the meals in an environmentally sound manner and preparing and storing them using energy saving methods, the leftovers from meals served in municipal nursery schools are also recycled in an environmentally friendly way in that they are used to produce biogas and consequently to generate electricity. 
Incidentally, packaging materials must be free of PVC, of plastics containing halogens and halogenated hydrocarbons. 
All the packaging material – around 100 tonnes per year – is collected by the catering company and taken to a professional, environmentally friendly recycling company. 
Public Lighting Light is life! 
Nevertheless, it can also have detrimental effects on flora, fauna and people. 
However, these can be reduced to a minimum with suitable, simple measures. 
The task of the Municipal Department for Public Lighting (MA 33) (“Vienna glows”) is to use light ecologically and efficiently. 
The high pressure mercury arc lamps that are still used in many areas no longer represent cutting-edge technology because their light is white and their light output is low. 
The light output of a high pressure sodium vapour lamp is twice as high as that of a high pressure mercury arc lamp. 
Scientific investigations also show that high pressure mercury arc lamps attract nocturnal insects because of their radiated light spectrum. 
By contrast, the yellow light of the high pressure sodium vapour lamp has a colour range, which attracts very few nocturnal insects. 
For these reasons, high pressure mercury arc lamps are no longer used in either MA 33’s new or existing equipment. 
Insects can be prevented from penetrating the illuminants through the use of closed lights. 
This means that the lights do not become dirty so quickly and insects are prevented from being burnt up on the lights. 
The use of lights with integrated optics and reflector systems allows the light scatter and consequently the extent to which insects are attracted to the light to be reduced. 
Lights with special mirror optics and the use of a corresponding cut-off technique – ensuring that the light only streams downwards – can also reduce the light pollution affecting the night sky from artificial light sources (“dark sky” project). 
In 2005, MA 33’s most important individual projects were, among other things, the redesign of the lighting on the Ringstraße together with MA 19, which succeeded in combining the latest light and mirror technology with a historic design. 
The results are impressive in that while energy costs have been cut by at least 30 per cent thanks to the new lighting, at the same time the lighting level has been increased by 20 per cent! 
Other projects related to the development of a new lighting scheme for the Resselpark and the refurbishment of the lighting on Höhenstraße. 
MA 13 – media wien The Municipal Department for Education, Out-of-School Activities for Children and Young People – media wien (MA 13) is involved in various environmentally-relevant activities because of the office’s remit. 
As far as the photographic studio is concerned, the chemical development process for films – which was needed in the previously used photochemistry – was replaced entirely by digital photography at the beginning of 2005. 
This has meant that the operation of the photographic studio has now become extremely environmentally friendly. 
Waste plastic, waste metal and waste glass as well as electronic scrap are accumulated when repairing electronic appliances. 
The batteries for these appliances must also be exchanged individually. 
Waste accumulated during repairs is taken to the relevant waste containers or disposed of at the city of Vienna’s refuse disposal sites. 
When devices for which repair is no longer cost effective are dismantled, fully functional spare parts remain that can still be used for other devices. 
This both saves resources and generates an economic profit. 
Waste paper is disposed of in the relevant containers and collected regularly. 
While the use of information technology means that less paper is accumulated, this is offset by the fact that the volume of work is higher. 
Vienna’s Hospitals: 
“The Wiener Krankenanstaltenverbund (KAV – Association of Viennese Hospitals) is committed to the ideas and aims of comprehensive environmental protection,” asserts the mission statement of the KAV. 
The environmental work of the KAV is based on environmental legislation and focuses on the sparing use of resources as well as the benefits for patients and staff in the sense of its mandate to heal and maintain health. 
The following measures have been implemented to date within the KAV on the basis of the “environmental development plan”: the commitment to environmental protection by the entire cooperative management (environmental policy), the nomination of contact persons for environmental issues in the cooperative managements, the establishment of environmental teams in all institutions and the exchange of information with the leaders of the environmental teams in the environmental forum. 
Plans are in place to complete implementation of the basic elements of an environmental management system (environmental programme, structural organisation, environmental audit, environmental law, environmental monitoring, environmental declaration, internal audit, management evaluation) in all KAV institutions by the end of 2009. 
Project work in the KAV: 
Savings from environmental protection projects should be credited to new similar projects, which not only increases motivation but also leads to further cost savings. 
In addition, work will go ahead on projects with direct and indirect financial benefits. 
Projects with direct financial benefits: in 2004, the use of mineral water was reduced by a third compared with 2003.The use of ecological washing and cleaning agents has resulted in savings of more than 90 tonnes of cleaning chemicals per year (which equates to around € 280,000). 
By optimising the separation between the individual categories of waste and improving the extent to which containers are filled, some € 250,000 worth of additional costs has been absorbed per year. 
Further savings of more than € 10 million are expected from energy benchmarking, water saving measures and the introduction of environmental management systems. 
Projects with indirect financial benefits: the proportion of organic foods has been increased to 30.14 per cent on average. 
It was also demonstrated that – without spending more – that the proportion of organic foods can be increased without spending more if organic food that is freshly cooked in-house replaces conventional ready-meals. 
Ecological construction projects, which have created optimal indoor conditions, were completed in SZB and GZB. 
Work also continued on the issues of avoiding PVC, recyclable materials, protecting green areas and training. 
The City of Vienna Buys “Green“ 
The EcoBuy Vienna project was created in 1999 to focus the purchase of goods, products and services (“procurement”) by the city administration, Viennese hospitals, Wiener Wohnen and Wiener Stadtwerke (public utilities company) more firmly on ecological issues. 
The large-scale project emerged from the Climate Protection Programme (KliP) and makes an important contribution to these goals. 
At the same time, the savings made have resulted in economic benefits. 
This is not exactly immaterial when one remembers that the city of Vienna spends around € 5 billion per year on a vast range of products, goods and services! 
Administration-Wide Organisation The EcoBuy Vienna project is organised administration-wide and is led by a project manager (Chief Executive Office – Executive Office for Urban Planning, Development and Construction) and a steering team. 
The practical work on the lists of criteria is carried out in specialist working groups by experts from all the relevant offices, organisations that are closely linked to the city of Vienna as well as external organisations. 
Independent advisory committees have been created to deal with “law”, “organisation” and “public relations”. 
In total there are 180 staff working at EcoBuy Vienna. 
A decree by the chief executive director of the city of Vienna makes the results mandatory in awarding contracts – something that is unique in Europe. 
Multi-faceted Public Relations Work A great deal of public relations work is undertaken to ensure that both the city’s staff and any interested parties from trade and industry as well as local people are aware of EcoBuy Vienna. 
Encouraging reports about EcoBuy Vienna in print media, on the Internet, in the city’s intranet and on radio and television – through press conferences, articles and interviews – is a neverending task. 
In the period 2004/2005, there were 150 media reports and some 80,000 people visited the EcoBuy Vienna website. 
Films, brochures, folders, posters and games are produced on specific issues. 
The specimen folders Ecological Office Paper and Ecological Printer Paper, which are available in German and English, are examples of this. 
Information and awareness-raising campaigns on the subject of organic food are conducted on an ongoing basis. 
The BIOBOX (see page 107) with five card games, a CD of animal sounds and a 104 page handbook as well as the film “Mamamio, alles bio!” (Let’s Go Green) with an accompanying folder and a 162 page handbook was produced to make children familiar with the subject of organic food through play. 
All municipal and private nursery schools as well as primary schools in Vienna have already received the BIOBOX and the video free of charge. 
International Recognition Vienna receives international recognition constantly for its EcoBuy Vienna project. 
In response to this, the International Activities Representative Office was established in 2004. 
In August 2004, EcoBuy Vienna was ranked among the 40 best practices at the Dubai International Award for Best Practices 2004 – an initiative by UN-HABITAT – from a total of 700 sustainability projects submitted worldwide! 
In October 2004, EcoBuy Vienna was invited to Sendai in Japan to establish an international network for environmentally friendly procurement. 
Through its work EcoBuy Vienna makes a major contribution to Vienna’s international reputation as a model environmental city. 
Further information is available from www.oekokauf.wien.at. 
Examples from Individual Working Groups • The Paper, Printing and Office Materials working group developed the first ecological criteria for office and printer paper across Europe in two specimen paper folders. 
• The Electrical Office and Household Appliances working group has drawn up lists of criteria for electric cookers, tumble-dryers, mobile phones, personal organisers and flat screens. 
• The Fleet working group dealt with the issues of vehicle purchase and vehicle disposal, driving operation and the workshops industry and organised several two-day intensive workshops. 
• The Domestic Engineering working group developed lists of criteria for hydronic under floor heating, water and energy saving valves and hot water and cold water pumps configured in-line. 
Other issues dealt with halogenfree tubes, load bearing systems and cables. 
• The Structural Engineering working group developed the Standardised Specification of Services for Structural Engineering. 
• The Interior Decoration working group drew up a list of criteria for interior developments. 
• The Foodstuffs working group constantly increased the proportion of organic food in Vienna’s hospitals, in old people’s homes, in children’s day care centres and schools. 
The proportion stands at 30 per cent in hospitals and at 50 per cent in children’s day care centres. 
• The criteria for environmentally friendly washing and cleaning agents were completed by the Cleaning working group. 
• The Civil Engineering working group drew up specimen texts for environmentally friendly construction tenders (ONR 22251) and the “quality compost in the construction industry” specification of services. 
• The new Textiles working group was established in March 2005 and carried out two workshops. 
• A PVC position paper was developed by a small inter-disciplinary group in 2005 and brought to the attention of all municipal offices and companies with a letter from the Director for Urban Development. 
Business and the Environment 
» Environmental Awareness among Vienna’s Business Community 
» The “Environmental Services Package” EcoBusinessPlan Vienna 
Businesses succeed in squaring the circle with the support of the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna 
Environmental Awareness among Vienna’s Business Community 
Vienna’s businesses are distinguished by a high degree of environmental awareness. 
Accordingly, they aspire to improving the quality of the environment in the city in addition to achieving economic success and they are energetically supported by the city administration – for example, in implementing the numerous but necessary rules and laws – in this aspiration. 
In the case of commercial equipment, for example, the Gewerbeordnung (Trade, Commerce and Industry Regulation Act) and the decrees issued on its basis are crucial for setting limits for emissions and for monitoring that they are complied with on a regular basis. 
If limits are set for specific toxic substances, they have to be complied with by businesses. 
Emissions of toxic substances, for which there is no regulation of this kind in place, are assessed according to their impact on the environment, primarily on the residential population, and limits are set accordingly in the course of the licensing procedure for the installation. 
In this connection, however, account must be taken of the best available technology at the time the installation was licensed for measures to limit airborne pollutants. 
Boilers and Furnaces in Businesses Boilers with a fuel heat output of more than 50 kilowatts have to be licensed on the basis of the “Emissionsschutzgesetz für Kesselanlagen” (2004) (act regulating emissions from boilers). 
In the case of businesses, this licence is issued as part of the procedure for licensing the installation site. 
Boilers for solid and liquid fuels with a fuel heat output of more than 100 kilowatts or boilers for gaseous fuels with more than 600 kilowatts are to be checked by an expert once a year. 
Emissions checks must be carried out at regular intervals on boilers with a fuel heat output of one megawatt or more. 
If the boiler has an output of more than two megawatts, an emissions certificate also has to be presented to the competent Municipal District Office every year.The permissible emissions limits for furnaces with a nominal heat output of more than 50 kilowatts are regulated in the “Feuerungsanlagen-Verordnung” (1997) (Furnaces Ordinance). 
This stipulates that the installations are to be checked every year, at which time their emissions are to be measured. 
Old installations must also satisfy this regulation by 1 June 2006 at the latest or they must be exchanged. 
In brief, the limits set for emissions are far stricter than the comparable EU directives. 
Limiting Emissions of Organic Solvents The “VOC Anlagenverordnung” (ordinance regulating emissions of volatile organic compounds) came into force on 1 September 2002. 
This regulates or limits emissions of organic solvents and is directed at businesses, which consume more than 500 kilograms of solvents per year. 
Businesses with enamelling lines, such as joineries, locksmith’s shops, vehicle workshops or dry-cleaning businesses as well as print shops, are examples of these. 
The “VOC Anlagenverordnung” imposed a great deal of work on Austrian businesses. 
On the one hand, the complexity of the regulations meant that the ordinance had to be examined in depth, which was extremely timeconsuming. 
On the other hand, VOC consumption had to be documented in detail and, in some cases, expensive measuring equipment was required. 
Reducing Emissions of Environmentrelevant Materials The “Chemikaliengesetz” (Chemicals Law) contains a large number of regulations concerning specific materials in order to prevent the dissemination and use of materials that are harmful to the environment, such as organic solvents, asbestos, heavy metals, ozone-depleting gases or greenhouse gases, poisons, etc. The stringent law has led to dangerous products being replaced by less harmful ones on the market. 
The “Industriegasverordnung” (ordinance regulating emissions of industrial gases), which came into force at the end of 2002 in response to the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol, has imposed various restrictions on climate-relevant gases. 
In essence, these are fully and partially halogenated hydrocarbons, which are used as refrigerants, solvents and extinguishing agents and as a propellant for aerosols. 
The use of sulphur hexafluoride as an insulating gas in high voltage switching equipment and as a filling gas in tyres and noise control windows is now limited in the interests of climate protection. 
The trend towards more environmentally friendly behaviour is also illustrated by the “Biozidproduktegesetz” (biocide products act), which came into force in October 2000. 
This regulates, for example, the use of cleaning, disinfecting and pest control products in homes and businesses. 
An EU decree came into effect in this connection at the end of 2003, which only permits certain active substances in biocide products. 
The evaluation of active substances, which is carried out at EU level, comprises a comprehensive risk assessment of the biocide products with regard to their toxicological consequences. 
In addition, the effectiveness of a specific biocide product must be demonstrated. 
These comprehensive evaluations aim to ensure a high degree of protection for mankind and the environment. 
Electronic Data Management for Waste Management The Ministry of Life’s Internet portal on electronic data management (www. abfallregister.at), which has been online since January 2005, is to lead, among other things, to a standard register for waste management master data (eRAS – electronic register for waste management master data). 
The “Abfallwirtschaftsgesetz” (AWG – Waste Management Act) 2002 already imposes various registration and reporting obligations on anybody collecting and/or handling dangerous and non-dangerous waste. 
Manufacturers, importers, systems and collection points also have to register in the course of implementing the “Elektroaltgeräte-Verordnung” (decree regulating the disposal of old electrical appliances). 
With regard to the reporting obligation applying to producers of dangerous waste, there is the option of registering via the EDM Portal and subsequently administering the master data (e.g. locations) oneself. 
Since the introduction of the register, some 1,000 Viennese companies have registered their locations.Vienna’s Municipal Department for Environmental Protection (MA 22) helps companies to register and offers comprehensive advice. 
Two information sessions were held on this subject especially for those Viennese companies involved in collecting and/or handling dangerous waste. 
MA 22 is in constant contact with the Ministry of Life (BMLFUW), in order to identify any problems connected with the introduction of the new system and to help to solve them. 
The “Environmental Services Package” EcoBusinessPlan Vienna 
Reusable packaging for hundreds of metro wagons, homes that are heated with the waste heat from bakeries and sparkling wine bottles that are 25 per cent thinner walled, thus helping to save producers € 290,000 per annum.What do all these projects have in common? 
They help to use resources economically, they improve economic performance – and they were developed and implemented within the framework of the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna! 
The programme has been running – extremely successfully – since 1998. 
Today, more than 500 companies are investing in environmental protection and their future within the framework of the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna. 
Through more than 9,000 voluntary measures, the EcoBusinessPlan businesses make a valuable contribution to the city’s sustainable development. 
Multinational groups such as Siemens or Henkel, the technology company Austrian Aerospace, the world heritage site Schloss Schönbrunn, Thomastik-Infeld, the global leader in strings for instruments and the traditional café Dommayer, where Johann Strauß once played the violin, are all EcoBusinessPlan Vienna businesses – as are many organic supermarkets or the “little baker round the corner”. 
The Environmental Package for Vienna’s Businesses The self-image of a modern municipal administration is in a state of flux. 
The issuing of laws and ordinances or various controls has long been only a part of the range of tasks facing us. 
The administration is increasingly becoming a service provider! 
The provision of advice on and support for voluntary measures supplements the setting of the regulatory policy framework. 
The success that can be achieved here is demonstrated by the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna model project, which is offered by MA 22 as an environmental services package. 
The companies that are most successful at protecting the environment are distinguished by the city. 
An Initiative that Pays Since the programme started, participating businesses have invested amost € 109 million on improving their ecoefficiency. 
By implementing their environmental protection projects they have saved € 30 million in operating costs and at the same time eased the burden on the environment to an astonishing extent. 
Energy consumption, for example, was cut by more than 138 gigawatts in total, which equates to the annual energy consumption of 46,200 Viennese households. 
Waste amounting to 109,300 tonnes, which would fill the ErnstHappel Stadium 1.3 times, was avoided! 
A total of 67.3 million transport kilometres, which equates to circumnavigating the globe 1,750 times, were not travelled. 
And these voluntary measures by firms as part of the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna pay off. 
On average, businesses have found their investment has paid off after 17 months! 
National and International Recognition: from Athens to Chennai The Ministry of Life (BMLFUW) has confidence in the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna and supports the programme with up to € 300,000 per year. 
The city of Vienna’s sustainability programme has become an international exemplar. 
More information on this subject is provided on page 118. 
The exemplary success of this programme has also been recognised elsewhere: for example UN-HABITAT has included the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna in the current list of the best sustainability projects worldwide, “Best Practice for Human Settlements”. 
Individual Environmental Programmes for Vienna’s Businesses The EcoBusinessPlan Vienna uses existing tools. 
Its modules, which are tailored to sectors and plant sizes, include established environmental management systems such as EMAS or ISO 14001 as well as the Austrian EcoQuality Label for Tourism, a national seal of environmental quality for businesses in the hospitality industry, restaurants and cafés. 
EcoBonus is a module that focuses on energy savings and waste management for small businesses. 
Since 2006, the programme has also contained a module on drawing up sustainability reports. 
Pilot projects on Sustainable Products and Services and Environmental Management Systems for Small Manufacturers are also ongoing. 
In this connection, the provision of external consultancy services is the key to success. 
Professional consultants work out individual environmental programmes together with the businesses in the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna. 
This allows them to square the circle: eco investment pays off for the environment and the business! 
The businesses implement all their environmental protection measures voluntarily. 
Their reward is financial benefits, a positive image and often competitive advantages as well. 
This action also improves quality of life in the city and further enhances Vienna’s status as a location for business! 
The EcoBusinessPlan Vienna is an Economic and Social Partnership in Action The Vienna Chamber of Commerce, the Institute for Economic Development Vienna and the Ministry of Life are represented in the EcoBusinessPlan Advisory Board, which advises on strategy, as are the employee institutions, the “Gewerkschaftsbund” (the Federation of Trade Unions) and the “Arbeiterkammer” (employees’ chamber) plus the Vienna Business Development Fund as well as administrative units from the city. 
These bodies and organisations also help run the programme. 
The operational centre for the programme is the programme management team at MA 22. 
Constant Improvement through External Evaluation The programme, which is evaluated according to the stringent criteria of the Institute for Environmental Economics at the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration, receives an outstanding report every time! 
On the basis of the results of the annual evaluation, the programme management team develops the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna systematically. 
The basis for the external evaluation is provided by the “action database” in which all operational measures, costs and successes are recorded electronically. 
The examiners have access to these data and evaluate them anonymously. 
The system of a database and external evaluation is now becoming a paradigm for the whole of Austria. 
The city of Vienna will henceforth make its expertise available to other provinces in cooperation with the Ministry of Life. 
The City of Vienna’s Environmental Award as part of the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna The City of Vienna’s Environmental Award has emerged from the EcoBusinessPlan Award. 
The accolade, which was awarded for the first time in 2005, is given in the categories “Innovation”, “Cooperation” and “Communication”. 
In the newly established “Open Category”, all Viennese companies are called on to submit an environmentally relevant project that has not yet been completed in order to obtain professional support in implementing it from the EcoBusinessPlan. 
The only precondition is that the business must have a site in Vienna. 
Every year, around 100 Viennese companies participate successfully in the modules of the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna. 
The four best companies are selected by a jury, consisting of members of the Advisory Board of the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna and distinguished with the City of Vienna’s Environmental Award during a ceremony in the following spring in the Grand Hall at the Vienna City Hall.The event is held under the patronage of the Mayor Michael Häupl and the Executive City Councillor for the Environment Ulli Sima. 
The 2005 Prize Winners • The prize in the category “Cooperation – integration of environmental action in social structures” went to Herold Druck und Verlag AG. 
The prize was awarded for the successful involvement of staff in developing and implementing environmental measures. 
The company has one of the most modern and fastest running printing machines in Austria. 
This requires precise adherence to the machine’s settings and operating processes as well as paper and colour properties tailored exactly to the machine. 
If one of these factors deviates, the speed at which the machine runs means that very substantial quantities of waste are generated very quickly – so-called “spoilage”. 
Through organisational measures, staff training sessions on reducing paper waste and close cooperation with suppliers of paper and printing ink, the paper waste for one year was reduced by 550 tonnes (initial figure: 1,500 tonnes/year spoilage including paper remnants). 
In addition to easing the pressure on the environment, this success generated savings of € 260,000 without any investment in equipment. 
This result was achieved solely through close cooperation between the management, staff and suppliers of the means of production! 
• The award for “Communication” that is successful communication about environmental measures internally and externally was given to Global 2000 and the Ströck bakery for the joint project, the Global-Vital-Weckerl (roll). 
Three major issues are combined in this roll: the preservation of diversity among useful plants, help for the “Chernobyl Children” and the promotion of organic agriculture. 
The Waldviertl-based organic farmer Josef Ehrenberger produces the old, nutty tasting “einkorn” wheat for the Ströck bakery. 
With each Global-Vital-Weckerl sold, 6 cents also go to the Global 2000 aid project, “Chernobyl Children”. 
This provides aid for Ukrainian children suffering from the consequences of the nuclear disaster there. 
• The firm WienWork received the prize in the “Innovation” category for its Solar Laundry project. 
An absorption type cooling plant was produced on the company’s site as a European prototype to cool and condition the air inside the laundry. 
The thermal process is driven by the heat from solar collectors. 
The existing wood chips heating plant, which is supplied with waste wood from the business’s own joinery, is integrated in the system as thermal backup. 
• In the “Open Category”, the prize was awarded to the cycling window cleaner Pascal Kellermayr. 
He has developed a niche concept for his cleaning company and only uses bikes and a special trailer system he has developed as a means of transport. 
This system allows him to transport a ladder that is almost nine metres long as well as all the equipment needed to clean windows. 
Vienna Environmental Report 2004/2005 
Foreword 
Right from the start, let me say how much I enjoy being responsible for environmental protection in Vienna! 
So many new projects have been initiated in our city over the years and so many good ideas developed to improve upon the quality of life, and there is such a strong commitment on the part of all those involved to achieving the aims and objectives. 
If I look back over the last two years, one of the first things which comes to mind is the importance of Vienna’s green belt.This wonderful area has surrounded the city for more than 100 years now – something which is unique for a city with more than one million inhabitants. 
Or the milestones in wastewater policy – the opening of the main sewage plant at the EbS, the most modern sewage plant in Europe. 
Or the accolades given to dozens of companies within the framework of the EcoBusinessPlan – they all contribute to protecting our environment. 
And there are so many other examples I could quote… 
Of course, in a period when fine dust has become a problem, we cannot remain silent about this serious environmental issue.The city takes this matter very seriously and has already adopted two packages of measures designed to reduce Vienna's contribution to fine dust still further. 
But one thing has to be said loud and clear, fine dust is not a local phenomenon, but is a Europe-wide environmental issue which can only be solved by a concerted effort on the part of municipalities, nation states and the European Union. 
At the same time, however, I am just like everybody else from Vienna – when I am in another large city and start to make comparisons,Vienna just comes off best. 
As proved by countless independent surveys and studies, Vienna is a city with an absolutely first class quality of life! 
In order to ensure that this remains so, Vienna’s environmental policymakers will have to continue their efforts in the next few years, but it is an effort that we are all pleased to make. 
I ask all Viennese to give us their continued support as we do so. 
Sincerely, Ulli Sima Executive City Councillor for the Environment 
Vienna and Europe 
» International Networks as a Stimulus 
» International Projects 
Europe’s cities are not just sources of environmental problems: they are also places where problem solutions are developed 
International Networks as a Stimulus 
In the context of sustainable development, cities and their conurbations have attracted interest in the last few decades, not only as the creators of environmental problems but also as places where innovations and solutions for such problems are developed. 
With its engagement in international networks and projects the city of Vienna is highlighting its determination to come up with local answers to global questions! 
Besides the projects receiving aid from the EU Commission, networks that go beyond national borders constitute the most important stimulus to cooperation in urban and regional environmental issues and also contribute to achieving appropriate positioning at a national and EU level. 
EUROCITIES Network As regards the environmental concerns affecting cities, special significance is attributed to the EUROCITIES network of major European cities, which already boasts more than 120 members. 
Vienna plays an active role in various forums here, allowing it to make a decisive contribution to current EU issues at a European level. 
The coordination of Vienna’s activities in the various forums of EUROCITIES is the responsibility of the Municipal Department for EU Strategy and Economic Development (MA 27). 
Services of General Interest In recent years services of general interest have increasingly become a focus of public attention. 
This has been prompted by the ambitions of the European Commission to subject all service sectors – also including those for drinking water, waste water, waste disposal and local public passenger transport – to the rules of the single market. The City of Vienna is unable to subscribe to this undifferentiated approach on the part of the European Commission because the provision of such high-level services of general interest play a key role in Vienna’s quality as a place to live and work! 
A. Water Resources As regards the environment two sectors above all are affected by the debate relating to liberalisation: 
• In its communication regarding the Internal Market Strategy 2003–2006 the EU Commission first announced its intention to review the competitive situation of the water sector in the form of a communication. 
In view of this alarming move towards liberalisation the city of Vienna felt compelled to set up an internal municipal work group to resist “water liberalisation”, with the objective of drawing up a catalogue of arguments opposing the possible liberalisation of water resources. 
The document completed in September 2004 contains the following core statements: 
The supply of water involves a natural monopoly, whereby the consumer can only ever call upon a single supplier. 
The analysis of the liberalisation measures performed to date clearly demonstrates that increases in efficiency and price reductions for consumers have not been achieved by opening up the market. 
To provisionally conclude its work on the catalogue of arguments MA 27 issued an info pack in April 2005 in cooperation with the Vienna Waterworks (MA 31). This pack, published in both German and English, lists the reasons against liberalisation of the water sector in the form of seven arguments in total. 
The vehement resistance shown by numerous parties and the city of Vienna to liberalisation of the water resources seems to have paid off! 
In April 2005 it was announced by representatives of the Commission at an information event held at the EU’s agency in Austria that the promised communication regarding evaluation of the water sector would not be issued. 
And that was not all: 
Further opening-up of the market in the water sector was not currently a priority in political terms in Europe! 
B. Waste Management • In the area of waste management the initiative towards opening-up of the market originated with the European Parliament, who passed a resolution asking the EU Commission to submit proposals in association with the competitiveness of this sector. 
The Parliament seems however to have subsequently moved away from its positive attitude towards liberalisation: 
In the resolution relating to the Commission’s green paper dated 14 January 2004 it explicitly asked for waste management to be excepted from the sectoral rules governing opening-up of the market! 
This is also the direction followed in the comments of the Austrian provinces in relation to the Commission’s “Green 1” and “White Paper 2” regarding services of general interest. 
In view of the ongoing discussion at the European level a work group was set up by the City of Vienna at the beginning of 2005 to draw up a catalogue of arguments against liberalisation of the waste management sector. 
With the example of the city of Vienna this catalogue of arguments demonstrates the superior level of quality and efficiency which can be achieved when waste management is organised on a municipal basis. 
Energy Performance Directive On 16 December 2002 the Directive of the European Parliament and the Council relating to the energy performance of buildings was published in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
The main stipulations of this directive are as follows: 
• The introduction of (one or more) characteristic values identifying the energy performance of buildings. 
Here consideration should be given not only to factors such as the building envelope but also to heating technology, provision of hot water, orientation of the building, utilisation of renewable sources of energy etc. • For these characteristic values binding minimum standards must be laid down for new buildings and must also be applicable to large-scale renovation projects. 
• Proof of energy performance (“energy performance certificate”) must be introduced for new buildings as well as for the leasing and sale of buildings. 
• For buildings accessible to the general public information about their energy standards must be displayed at a prominent location. 
• Heating and air-conditioning systems must be checked regularly in terms of their energy efficiency. 
The energy performance directive was to be transposed into national law by 4 January 2006, with a transitional period of up to three years being given here. 
Many aspects of transposition are the responsibility of the provinces, which are however striving towards harmonisation. 
Sixth EU Environment Action Programme The Environmental Forum, in which Vienna is represented by the Municipal Department for Environmental Protection (MA 22) comments on all proposals of the EU Commission with environmental relevance, works on joint projects and participates in an exchange of experiences. 
In 2004 and 2005 the focus fell on the thematic strategies relating to the 6th Environment Action Programme of the EU. 
The joint EU project Livable Cities dealing with environmental plans in European cities was started, and the results of the completed projects PRESUD and EMAS made public. 
In 2005 MA 22 took over the chair of the Waste Management work group and participates in the work group Environment and Health. 
In 2005 it initiated founding of the work group Greening the Local Economy, which it now also chairs. 
The Executive Office for the Co-ordination of Climate Protection Measures of the Chief Executive Office plays an active role in the work group Climate Protection, and the Vienna Ombudsoffice for Environmental Protection in the work group Procurement. 
Danube Cycle Path International Project Group On the occasion of the 15th conference (7 and 8 July 2005, Vienna) of the heads of government of the states represented in the ARGE Donauländer joint venture, it was agreed to connect the extremely popular Danube cycle path running from Passau through Vienna and Bratislava, which is of great importance to the “cycling economy” of the region, to other existing cycle paths and to extend it to the Danube Delta. 
Vienna has taken over chairmanship of the project group founded for this purpose. 
The ARGE Donauländer and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GTZ) are involved in this project. 
The aim is first to complete a survey in order to evaluate the condition of the cycle paths, their associated amenities, the existence of alternative means of transport (ship, railway, buses permitting the transport of bicycles) as well as the accommodation facilities available en route.The GPS-compatible results will not only be available as a printed document but also published on the Internet. 
Bern Convention MA 22 provides the joint Austrian state representative to the Bern Convention entitled “Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats”. 
In this function the joint state representative is a member of the standing committee and point of contact of the secretariat based at the Council of Europe. 
Vienna Days in Montenegro and SME Symposium In October 2005 the so-called Vienna Days took place in Podgorica and Ulcinj (Montenegro) under the title of Sustainable Urban Development in a New Europe. 
The sustainable environmental policy of the Austrian capital was described, as well as examples of technology. 
The city of Podgorica was presented with a sound level meter by MA 22. 
Another event that took place in October 2005 was the symposium Greening the Local Economy, organised by MA 22 under the programme EcoBusinessPlanVienna. It was held in Vienna’s city hall and was attended by experts from thirty countries throughout the world. 
At the two-day symposium the presentations and work revolved around further development and aid for environmental measures aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in cities. 
International Projects 
To date the City of Vienna has carried out some 80 EU-aided projects involving the environment. 
Projects are executed not just in Vienna but also with partners from all over Europe. 
MA 22 has carried out projects with EU aid since 1996. 
It was one of the first departments of the City of Vienna to take advantage of EU aid and in this context also retains its status as one of the leading departments. 
Monitoring the Alpine Region’s Sustainability The objective of the project Monitoring the Alpine Region’s Sustainability (MARS) concluded in 2005 was to establish indicators for monitoring sustainable development in the Alpine regions which are also suitable for benchmarking between the regions. 
The project was cofinanced under the INTERREG III B programme. 
The project partner of the province of Vienna was MA 22. 
EcoBusinessPartnership Projects The know-how developed under the EcoBusinessPlan Vienna has meet with great interest at an international level! 
In the framework of a project cofinanced under an INTERREG III A programme Vienna is currently providing assistance in developing an EcoBusinessPlan to the western Hungarian city of Györ, and to the Albanian port of Durres via a partnership financed by the Association of Austrian Cities and Towns. 
Under the EU programme ASIA URBS feasibility studies have been carried out for Athens and the Indian city of Chennai, while MA 22 is contributing know-how for the implementation of environmental management systems in companies for the INTERACT project Ionian and Adriatic Cities and Ports Cooperation (IONAS). 
Technology Offensive Solar Thermal Engineering The primary objective of the project SOLARNET II – Experts Network Vienna –Hungary was to change the outline conditions for the spread of solar thermal engineering in Vienna to ensure that the goals of the Vienna Climate Protection Programme in the field of solar thermal engineering can be achieved. 
Cooperation with Hungary has permitted implementation of the European standard in the solar sector in the form of the Hungarian qualification of “Solateur” or solar technician. 
In addition, a number of measures has improved the sales prospects of companies from Austria and in particular Vienna in the Hungarian market. 
The project was carried out in the framework of the EU programme INTERREG III A and completed in July 2005. 
Geothermal Heat Generation in Aspern In the framework of the Climate Protection Programme Vienna is striving to offer a municipal energy supply that does as little harm as possible to both resources and the climate. 
Against this background the potential of geothermal heat and power generation in the urban development region of Aspern is currently under review from the viewpoint of ecology and energy economy in comparison with other energy supply options. 
The project is the subject of cofinancing from the EC in the framework of INTERREG III B CADSES. 
Danube Floodplain Nature Education The Lobau, one of Vienna’s finest local recreational areas, forms an important part of the Donau Auen National Park. 
This largely unspoilt treasure of nature, one of the last of its kind in Europe, includes not only the riverside areas of the Danube in Lower Austria but also extensive floodplains of the rivers March and Thaya in regions close to the border with Slovakia and the Czech Republic. 
Awakening an understanding for the valuable and finely balanced ecosystem is the objective of the EU INTERREG III A project Danube Floodplain Nature Education. 
Here the development of a “ Danube floodplain interactive educational and recreational nature programme” represents an important step in this direction. 
The project is the responsibility of the Forestry Office of the city of Vienna (MA 49) and project partners in the Czech Republic (LIPKA in Brno) and in Slovakia (DAPHNE in Bratislava). 
The Lobau National Park House has come into being as the common venue for events. 
Cross Border Climate Protection (CroBoClip) In 2004 the residents of Vienna were able to see for themselves what efficient heat insulation can achieve at a spectacular demonstration held on Marihilfer Straße. In 2005 the residents of the western Hungarian city of Györ were also able to observe how an enormous block of ice set up in the town centre withstood sun and rain while completely wrapped in insulating material. 
The ice block event was organised under the heading of Building and Living as a key area of the Heat Insulation campaign under the EU project Cross Border Climate Protection (CroBoClip) and gave expression to the city partnership for cross border climate protection between Austria and Hungary. 
It is above all in Györ with its baroque-style old town that great importance is attributed to ecological insulation for the renovation of old buildings, with this equally being the case with new projects, where low energy buildings are an important topic. 
The key focus on Insulation was followed in 2005 by the campaign Climate Protection in Schools. 
In 2006 the Cro BoClip theme was Fair Trade, involving a range of cross-border workshops, brochures and events. 
CONVIBA Contracting In the framework of a pilot project organised at the school Paulusgasse Primary School a new tender collection procedure was developed for contracting together with the Austrian Society for Environment and Technology (ÖGUT) (see also chapter “The City Administration Working for a Better Environment”). 
Under the project Contracting Vienna Bratislava (CONVIBA) the “Vienna Energy-Saving Contracting Model” was presented to the Slovakian project partners, the city of Bratislava and the Energy Centre Bratislava. 
Experts from the city of Vienna, who in the initial phase were entrusted with showing companies how successful contracting works, inspected over 20 potential contracting properties in Bratislava together with their Slovakian colleagues, examining them for their potential in terms of energy savings. 
In future Bratislava also plans to renovate public buildings using energy-saving contracting! 
Building ecology Vienna/Bratislava A group of students from the Vienna University of Technology and the Slovak University of Technology of Bratislava worked with their tutors investigating existing residential areas as regards their quality in terms of building ecology and developed suggestions for improvement. 
Here the focus of attention not only fell on ensuring that the design of the developed environment caters for the needs of the user but above all on the quality of the structures in terms of building ecology. 
The exchange of experiences and results took place in the form of work meetings, seminars and reciprocal visits including presentations. 
Cross Border Environmental Organisation The objective of this project was the exchange of know-how in association with the communication of environmental themes – specifically for the subject of nutrition in schools and nurseries. 
Environmentally educational methods were demonstrated together with the partner organisations as well as activities involving nutrition, offering a forum providing for the exchange of experiences and methods and the discussion of possible cooperation measures and follow-up projects. 
At the core of another project was the planning, preparation and organisation of a cross-border youth film competition dealing with the subject of the environment. 
One of the participants in the Youth Environmental Film Competition Vienna–Brno was not only the winner in the youth competition but also carried off the silver medal in the main contest. 
The prize – the opportunity of taking part in the Austrian National Championship in Klagenfurt – even resulted in another victory: the award of one of the four gold medals! 
Here the crossborder cooperation project not only involved joint preparations for the event but also the formation of a panel of topclass judges. 
KATER – KArst waTER Research Programme Throughout Europe karstic regions represent one of the most important natural resources for the supply of drinking water. 
For example, the city of Vienna obtains by far the largest part of its needs from the headwaters of the northern limestone alps, while Italy, Slovenia and Croatia also have aboveaverage dependence on the water reserves of the karstic regions. 
Partners from these countries thus play an active role in the KATER II project, which is devoted to improving the management of resources on the basis of a transnational network. 
In view of the fact that karstic regions are extremely sensitive ecosystems increasingly at risk from tourism, agriculture, forestry and the use of alpine pastureland, transport systems and residential development, it is not surprising that there is an extremely wide range of challenges to be faced here. 
Besides work involving the natural sciences and the development of software programs, public information activities are also underway in the framework of the project under the coordination of MA 31. 
Regional Development through JORDES+ 2006 saw completion of the regional development project Joint Regional Development Strategy for the ViennaBratislava-Györ region (JORDES+), which has been ongoing since 2002. 
The results are available as a trilingual publication and also in digital form. 
The central message of the project is the development perspective of a “biosphere growth region”, which is based on the conditions prevailing in the outstanding natural landscapes of the Vienna region, the surrounding countryside of Lower Austria, northern Burgenland, the city and district of Bratislava, district of Trnava and county Györ-Moson-Sopron. 
JORDES+ was developed by Regional Consulting GmbH together with the country partners of the PGO (Planning Cooperation East), submitted as an INTERREG III A F aid project and cofinanced by the provinces of Burgenland, Lower Austria and Vienna. 
Implementation of the development strategy agreed in JORDES+ also entails expansion of the railway network between Vienna and Bratislava. 
This is designed to make public transport for passenger and freight traffic more attractive as a key prerequisite for measures aimed at reducing the level of environmental pollution caused by motor vehicles. 
One example of this is the introduction of a fast rail link between Vienna and Bratislava, which aims to cut the travel time to 40 minutes. 
Here it is necessary among other things to improve the Marchegger branch line by making it two-track, electrifying the line upgrading it to allow a maximum speed of 160 kilometres per hour. 
However it is unfortunately apparent that the timescale communicated by the federal government for implementation of the project is not in line with the political intentions of the Eastern region. 
In the context of Slovakia’s foreseeable accedence to the Schengen agreement and the resulting abolition of border controls the development of the public transport system should be driven forward swiftly in this regard in order not to thoughtlessly jeopardise its competitive ability currently existing vis-à-vis road traffic! 
CER2 and KinG MA 27 is involved in the EU project CER2 (a transnational framework project with 14 partners) that is linked to KinG (a skills network for innovative building technology from seven different countries with the aim of supporting renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency measures). 
Here the motivation and objective is to boost productivity in terms of innovation in the building technology branch and to reinforce the image of the branch with regard to partners from the planning and property sectors as well as information, development and the exchange of know-how about innovative products and systems in the area of building technology. 
Housing and Ecology 
» Ecology in Residential Construction 
Vienna is taking the next step towards climate protection with passive housing 
Ecology in Residential Construction 
Enormous Energy Savings in Housing The city of Vienna’s guidelines are leading to remarkable energy savings in housing. 
This is clear from a comparison of the average heating costs for an 80 square metre flat constructed in different periods: 
• “1970s standard” (120 to 200 kilowatt hours per year and square metre) annual heating costs: around Euro 550.00 • “1990s standard” (80 kilowatt hours per year and square metre) annual heating costs: around Euro 360.00 • Low energy house (35 to 50 kilowatt hours per year and square metre) annual heating costs: around Euro 210.00 • Passive house (15 kilowatt hours per year and square metre) annual heating costs: around Euro 60.00 
While low energy housing was still rare a few years ago, it has now become standard. 
The city of Vienna will only subsidise residential construction projects that comply with low energy standards. 
As a development of this policy, the first passive house projects are already under construction. 
However, environmental and climate protection is not just a vital element in new construction but also in the rehabilitation of housing (the keyword being Thewosan). 
The city is also involved in various projects, such as the SIBAT research project, to guarantee indoor air quality. 
And with the help of RUMBA, a total of 1,000 residential units are currently under construction in Simmering – at “Europe’s most environmentally friendly construction site”. 
Ecology in Residential Construction The objective of the new Viennese residential construction policy is to link economic targets with planning and ecological ones and consequently to increase the “housing value” long-term. 
Low energy houses or innovative environmental technologies such as the recovery of heat from outgoing air and waste water, heat pumps, solar panels and insulated façades have become standard in new buildings within a very short period of time. 
Activities are now also increasingly concentrated on the rehabilitation of buildings. 
Highest Environmental Standards in New Building The low energy standard is mandatory for the construction of all new subsidised residential buildings. 
All projects have individual water meters and more and more use is made of solar energy. 
Systems to recover waste water and outgoing air, heat pumps, domestic use water systems and roof gardens are also found more and more frequently in subsidised residential construction projects.The construction materials used are produced using environmentally friendly methods as far as possible.This also has a perceptibly positive impact on the people living in these new homes: Their health improves and their energy bills are far lower. 
Builder Competitions and the Land Advisory Board The core item in ecological residential construction in Vienna is the public builder competitions run by the city for several contiguous residential construction projects that are to be tendered for separately and which are usually located in urban development areas. 
Ratios and criteria relating to planning quality, economy and environmental relevance/ ecology are developed for the invitation to bid, against which the projects submitted, are assessed by a specialist jury. 
Parallel to the builder competitions all other residential housing projects, where an application is made for grants, have been examined by a Land Advisory Board since autumn 1995. 
This, like the specialist jury, is composed of architects, representatives from the housing industry and the city of Vienna as well as specialists in ecology/environmental technology, economy and law and, among other things, assesses the position of the project in the urban area. 
The Land Advisory Board has assessed some 78,121 homes since it was established. 
Abandonment of Halogenated Hydrocarbons Since 1999, the city of Vienna has avoided construction materials containing halogenated hydrocarbons (CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs). 
It has also abandoned KPS insulating boards and polyurethane foam in cans. 
Since 2000, noise protection windows in subsidised housing construction have no longer been filled with fully fluorinated sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), which is an extremely powerful greenhouse gas. 
These materials are monitored through the builder competitions and the Land Advisory Board. 
The absence of HCFCs and HFCs in insulating materials and polyurethane foam in cans is a basic precondition for obtaining a grant. 
The halogenated hydrocarbons, CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs contribute about eighteen per cent to the greenhouse effect in Austria. 
Vienna’s Passive House Developments The city is taking the next step towards climate protection with passive housing. 
Thanks to the use of ingenious technologies, passive houses only need half to one third of the heating energy required by low energy houses and only one tenth of the energy consumption of houses constructed in the 1970s. 
Among other things, they have special insulating layers, heat exchangers, geothermal heat collectors and solar panels, which mean that rooms no longer require a separate heating system.This saves energy and, of course, heating costs! 
The first genuine passive house is a three storey wooden structure in Spöttlgasse in the 21st district. 
The results of the project are currently being evaluated. 
At 15 kilowatt hours per square metre of useful space and year, the thermal heat requirement of a passive house is around 80 per cent below the figure for a traditional building. 
The heating load may amount to a maximum of ten watts. 
This figure is so low that a room in a house of this kind can be heated with the heat from two light bulbs! 
In addition, it is distinguished by the following criteria: 
• A special insulation, consisting of several layers of mineral, biogenous and fire-proof construction materials, forms a highly effective thermal storage mass. 
• There are no cold and warmth bridges in the entire structure. 
• The flats are 80 per cent heated by recovering heat from the outgoing air (cross-flow heat exchanger). 
In this connection the heat from the outgoing air is passed to the fresh air coming in. • Geothermal heat collectors and solar panels are used to heat water and to heat the rooms. 
In addition to the low energy bills, the subsidies granted by the city of Vienna militates in favour of constructing passive houses. 
Since spring 2003, the “green subsidy” has been available not just for the construction of flats but also for residential housing on allotments and for one and two family houses. 
If a house of this kind is built in compliance with low energy standards, a nonrepayable grant of Euro 5,800.00 is available in addition to the normal residential construction funding. 
A grant of Euro 9,800.00 is available for a house that recovers heat through a mechanical ventilation system. 
A passive house attracts an additional grant of Euro 11,500.00. 
In addition, the investment costs for installing heat pumps to heat the rooms and water are supported with grants of Euro 4,500.00 and Euro 8,000.00 and the installation of gas-fired condensing boilers is eligible for a oneoff grant of Euro 1,500.00 or Euro 1,250.00. 
The Future belongs to the “Passive House” A few passive-low energy houses – transitional models from a low energy house to a passive house, as it were – are already under construction. 
In December 2002, a passive-low energy house was completed in Katharinengasse 10/Favoritenstraße in the 10th district. 
It is equipped with earth cooling tubes, solar panels on the roof, counter current heat exchangers as well as after heater units and a supplementary heating system using re-circulated air, with the help of which the residents can regulate the room temperature. 
A total of 90 energy saving flats ranging in size from 33 to 109 square metres has been constructed on this area. 
A second passive-low energy building was completed as part of the Wienerberg City development and a further passive-low energy building with 200 flats has also been completed on Kammelweg in Floridsdorf. 
Other properties are in the planning stage. 
Thewosan: 
Rehabilitation as a Challenge Today, the major challenge of ecological residential construction lies in rehabilitation. 
Many of the residential premises constructed after 1945 can be ranked among the worst energy consumers. 
Currently there are still around 300,000 flats in blocks constructed between 1945 and 1980 in Vienna. 
Since March 2000, the city has been promoting their thermal rehabilitation via the socalled Thewosan scheme. 
In the first two years, some Euro 500 million was invested, of which some Euro 170 million were subsidies. 
On average, a block that has been rehabilitated with the help of Thewosan needs 50 per cent less energy than before to heat its rooms! 
The 2003 rehabilitation amendment introduced specific incentives for particularly efficient and environmentally friendly measures covered by the Thewosan assistance. 
A fourth class of funding has been added to the thermal rehabilitation programme. 
In addition to a one-off amount of Euro 30, 45, 60 or 75/square metre of useful space, a further amount of Euro 20/square metre can be paid for additional thermal rehabilitation measures in connection with improvements to the cladding (for particularly efficient and environmentally friendly facilities or energy sources). 
If you are eligible for a grant of Euro 60 or 75/square metre, you also have the option of obtaining a loan from the provincial government that is equal to the non-repayable amount (maximum one third of the rehabilitation costs).The grading of the funding is dependent on the type and extent of the rehabilitation measures and on the savings in energy and emissions that can be achieved: 
The clearer the energy saving, the higher the possible funding. 
The measures stipulated range from adding a heatinsulating façade, to insulating the top storey ceiling or the cellar ceiling, to installing thermal protection windows and finally to exchanging old heating systems for new, more energy efficient ones. 
Problems caused by major construction sites (Vienna) • Two thirds of inner city goods traffic (in tonnes) is attributable to building materials, 99 per cent of construction site traffic is handled by lorry. 
• Despite only accounting for one per cent of total traffic, around 10 per cent of NOx and particle emissions are attributable to construction site traffic. 
• A two-axle lorry of 18 tonnes imposes 17,000 more wear and tear on roads than a car, while the wear and tear from a four-axle lorry of 36 tonnes is 30,000 times greater. 
The dust generated by abrasion of the roads and tyres accounts for 50 per cent of the emissions of particulates from traffic. 
• The construction of one flat requires 60 lorry trips covering a total of 2,500 to 3,000 kilometres. 
• 75 per cent of waste is residual building waste: only a third of which is recycled. 
• 13 per cent of residents are disturbed by noise from construction. 
Gentle Urban Redevelopment In 1996, the Vienna city administration decided to adopt a new policy with regard to residential construction and rehabilitation. 
Since then, the focus has been on developing and rehabilitating the centre, which needs redevelopment. 
Some 60 per cent of all new construction projects are also based there. 
A points system, which attaches particular importance to the position of the project, has led to inner city rehabilitation projects being given priority. 
Accordingly the majority of projects involving the rehabilitation of residential premises are located in the 2nd, 5th, 10th, 15th, 17th and 20th districts.This also means that better use can be made of existing infrastructure, avoiding traffic, which is another important contribution to environmental protection in Vienna. 
Good Indoor Air Quality The city of Vienna also promotes the dissemination of new scientific findings in the field of ecology. 
In February 2004, an international congress on the subject of “a healthy atmosphere at home” supported by the city took place at the MessezentrumWienNeu. 
In particular, options for creating the framework conditions for minimising pollutants in subsidised housing were identified. 
The range of topics covered extended from the presentation of new calculation models to assess the subsequent costs of poor air quality to questions on the development of standards for dealing with health problems caused by poor air quality indoors to commissioning services in a way that takes account of the environment and people’s health. 
The contributions and workshops showed, among other things, how research and development cross over with practical experiences and lead to projects such as SIBAT (ensuring indoor air quality of buildings through the choice of building materials) or to buildings certificates, which contribute to toxic substances being avoided during the construction phase. 
Good indoor air quality also has a great deal to do with environmentally friendly purchasing. 
The city of Vienna’s ÖkoKauf (Think Green – Buy Green) project has been dealing with this issue for years (see “The City Administration Working for a Better Environment” chapter). 
It aims to include criteria that help to minimise toxic substances in the product through the specification of services in the course of awarding contracts. 
Since any problem substances not brought inside will be unable to cause a problem inside! 
Environmentally Friendly Construction Site Management Across Europe, environmental measures are being reinforced particularly at major construction sites in urban areas. 
Emissions of toxic substances, noise and dust as well as problems caused by building site vehicles constitute major environmental burdens in inner cities. 
The figures cited in the “Problems caused by Major Construction Sites” box relate to Vienna but are doubtless transferable to other cities as well. 
As a body responsible for the EU-LIFE research project RUMBA (Guidelines for Sustainable Construction Site Management), the city of Vienna has been dealing with this issue for three years and presented its results at the end of 2004. 
Various types of measures for managing construction sites in a sustainable manner were implemented at eight construction sites in three demonstration projects. 
The demonstration projects focused on the following topics: 
• Rail instead of trucks: 
Eco-balanced transportation of excavated material and prefabricated parts via rail (see too the “Mobile in Vienna” chapter). 
• Sustainable construction site management: 
Pre-sorting of residual building materials, reduction in dust, reduction in the trips to dispose of waste. 
All aims, which are, among other things, being scrupulously pursued at construction projects managed by the Sports Office (MA 51). 
• The RUMBA builder competition: 
Integrated planning for sustainable construction site management within the framework of a competition (residential development with around 1,000 flats). 
The Most Environmentally Friendly Residential Construction Site in Europe As part of the “Viennese approach” a competition to select the builder for a residential development in ViennaSimmering (Thürnlhof) with a total of 1,000 residential units (around 20 per cent of Vienna’s annual residential construction) was carried out as a RUMBA demonstration project. 
Following initial scepticism on the part of the companies carrying out the construction, the logistics management systems at the construction site are so well established that the first fruits of this “most environmentally friendly construction site in Europe” are already apparent. 
The majority of the earth extracted was used as backfill for a road construction project in the vicinity (S 1). 
The accounts for the previous earth movements show a marked reduction in toxic substances through the almost exclusive use of EURO-III vehicles (98.5 per cent). 
When work starts on the building shell, prefabricated pieces will be delivered by rail using combined transport via a logistics centre. 
For the finishing, a general fee has been stipulated for all transports as an incentive towards greater efficiency. 
The first 500 homes at the Thürnlhof-Ost construction site are expected to be completed at the end of 2006. 
Incidentally, the “Urbane Luft Initiative” (ULI = Urban Air Initiative) (see too “Vienna’s Air” chapter) follows the RUMBA results in its proposals for measures on construction sites: an eco balance for the combined transport was submitted in the “5th RUMBA roundtable” for the Kabelwerk KDAG construction site. 
The balance was expanded in the ULI project about the relevance of diffuse emissions during construction. 
Planned measures as part of Vienna’s air strategy include the retrofitting of construction machinery with particle filters and the extension of the city of Vienna’s regulations on avoiding unnecessary dust from storage to demolition, manipulation and reloading during construction.
